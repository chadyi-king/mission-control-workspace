## Key Decisions

**Dashboard Hosting:** GitHub Pages → Render.com (30s updates vs 10min)

**Agent Status:**
- Active: CHAD_YI, Helios
- Configured/not spawned: Escritor, Quanta, MensaMusa, Autour
- Helios audits every 15 min (now includes CHAD_YI)

**Task Priorities:**
- HIGH with deadlines: A1-1 (Feb 13), B6-1/B6-3 (Feb 17)
- Everything else: MEDIUM or BACKLOG

**Dashboard Layout:**
- Home: Urgent Queue | Agent Activity | Input Needed | Calendar
- Categories: 19 project cards
- System: Agent roster with click-to-expand
- Resources: Document upload per agent

## How I Should Behave

1. **Verify fixes** - Screenshot before/after, don't ask user to check
2. **Only change tasks/agents** in data.json - never touch structure
3. **Use memory** - Search before asking, update after decisions
4. **Be concise** - Don't overwhelm with text walls
5. **Helios tracks me too** - He audits my task progress every 15 min
