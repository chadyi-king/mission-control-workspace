- Dialogue format: Character (emotion): "Dialogue"
- Action scenes: Detailed sensory, tactical analysis

**Character Voices:**
- **Ryfel:** Precise, strategic, Navy SEAL mindset, respectful but independent
- **Ryker:** Loud, enthusiastic, physical, "Little Ry", "my boy"
- **Elda:** Sharp, measured, dry humor, caring worry
- **Kriscila:** Fierce but vulnerable with Ryfel

**Magic System:**
- 5 elements: Earth, Water, Fire, Air, **LIGHT**

3. Self-check: Callbacks included? Voice consistent?
4. Submit to Helios for CHAD_YI review
5. Revise based on feedback
6. Final approval → Mark complete
