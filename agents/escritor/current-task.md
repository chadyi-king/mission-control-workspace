## Process

1. **Read everything** - Story Bible first, then Chapters 11-12 (most recent), then earlier chapters as needed
2. **Take notes** - Document your understanding of each element
3. **Generate questions** - Where is your understanding uncertain? What needs clarification?
4. **Format output** - Save questions to `/agents/escritor/outbox/study-questions.md`
5. **Wait for Caleb's answers** - Do NOT proceed to writing until Caleb validates your understanding

---

## Success Criteria
- 80+ total questions generated
- Questions show deep engagement with source material
- Questions reveal specific uncertainties (not generic)
- Caleb can answer to validate Escritor's understanding

## Note
**This is a TEST phase.** Caleb wants to verify Escritor understands the story correctly BEFORE writing. Generate questions that will expose any misunderstandings.
