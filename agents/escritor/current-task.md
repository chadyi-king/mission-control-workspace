## Chapter Context

**Current Story State:**

- **Location**: Prison/Slavery compound
- **Mood**: Darker, survival/political intrigue
- **Tone**: 70% serious, 30% warmth/comedy

## Writing Objectives

**Primary Goal:** Write Chapter 13 - "Captivity"

**Key Elements to Include:**
1. **Ryfel's SEAL mindset** applied to prison survival
2. **Earth magic innovation** - tactical use of limited magic
3. **Bram's presence** - develop his character alongside Ryfel
4. **Political intrigue** - who captured them and why?
5. **At least 2 callbacks** to previous chapters
6. **Chapter hook** - end with momentum toward escape or revelation

**Callbacks to Consider:**
- [ ] 3-year promise with Kriscila (she's waiting)
- [ ] Ryfel's revenge vow to Knight Commander
- [ ] "Traps never fail" - blacksmith's philosophy
- [ ] Ryker's training (what would big brother do?)
- [ ] Elda's worry (she's pregnant, will stress affect her?)
