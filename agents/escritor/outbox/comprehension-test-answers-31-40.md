## Q31: Runevia's Infiltration
- **What they're trying to do:** Delay the tournament to create a distraction. The shadowy figures whisper among officials, wanting more time to execute their plan.
- **Real target:** The walls of the Farmland district. They needed the tournament to last longer to distract everyone while they prepared to breach the walls.

---

## Q32: The Three Trials
**The 3 trials:**
1. Team Trial
2. Invention Trial  
3. Individual Trial

**Skipped:** Team and Invention trials were skipped because Ryfel's team single-handedly incapacitated nearly all fighters from the other districts, leaving no one to continue. The tournament moved straight to Individual finals.

## Q33: Ryfel's Inventions
1. **Flashbang grenades** - Create blinding white light and deafening sound to disorient enemies (used against Air Fighters and Bram)
2. **Sonic grenades/mines** - Emit high-frequency sonic blasts that damage hearing and cause disorientation (used against Water Leader)
3. **Sticky frag grenades** - Adhesive explosive bombs that stick to targets before detonating (used against Blacksmith District)
4. **Grappling hooks** - For mobility, trapping opponents, and creating mid-air combat opportunities
5. **Tear gas grenades** - Release stinging smoke that overwhelms senses (used against Viktor)
6. **Revolver-style gauntlet rifle** - Fires elemental bullets made of earth, metal, and fire (used against Aurex)

## Q34: Team Bonding
**Specific moment:** After defeating the Magic District, the team exchanges banter about Dain's "Body Detonation" attack name, with Kriscila calling it gross and Bram wanting to name his attacks too. This lighthearted teasing shows their growing camaraderie.

Another key moment: After Dain's fight with Ryfel, Dain admits "Guess I'm still me, huh?" and Ryfel helps him up, saying "You're more than you think, Dain. You proved that out there." Their handshake solidifies their bond.

---

## Q35: Dain's Redemption
**What happens:** Dain fights Ryfel using boxing techniques with stone-spiked knuckles, refusing to stay down despite being completely outmatched. He takes a brutal beating but keeps rising until his armor shatters, revealing years of abuse scars.

**How Dain changes:** His family (Lord Luthren and brothers) witness his unyielding spirit and finally apologize for their years of abusive "training." Dain realizes he doesn't need to prove anything to anyone—he's already strong on his own terms. He finds his self-worth and becomes a true teammate.

## Q36: Outer Courts Leadership
**Being "Head of Outer Courts" controls:**
1. **District governance** - Authority over policy decisions affecting all five Outer Court districts
2. **Military coordination** - Control of combined district defenses and military responses
3. **Resource allocation** - Distribution of resources and trade agreements between districts
4. **Tournament oversight** - Authority to host and set terms for the Contender Tournament

---

## Q37: Minas-Col's Hiding
**Why Minas-Col hides:** They hide behind massive walls and perpetual fog to protect themselves from external threats—specifically from Runevia, a rival kingdom with superior magic and military power.

**What they're hiding from:** Runevian aggression and potential invasion. The walls are their primary defense against the Magic Knights of Runevia, who eventually breach them in Chapter 12 with devastating force.

---

## Q38: Chapter 13 Setup
**3 unresolved threads:**
1. **Ryfel's capture** - Ryfel is taken prisoner by the Runevian Magic Knights, leaving Farmland without its champion
2. **Bram's capture** - Bram is also captured by the Knight Commander after Grandpa Ironfoot's sacrifice
3. **The Runevian threat** - The invasion has only begun; 150 Magic Knights attacked, killed ~1,000 people, and captured ~300 young magic users. More attacks are imminent.

**Additional threads:** Healing the wounded (Ryker lost a leg, Milal unconscious, Aurex dead), and defending against future Runevian incursions.

---

## Q39: Grandpa Ironfoot
**Role:** Bram's grandfather, mentor, and biggest supporter. He cheers aggressively from the stands, shouts encouragement during fights, and embodies the Ironfoot family's pride.

**Disappointed but respectful:** He's disappointed Bram lost to Ryfel (even yelling "You dolt of a lovable grandson! You can't be losing to a woman!" during the Bram vs Kriscila fight), but acknowledges Ryfel's skill: "Hmph… smart move, boy." After Bram loses to Ryfel, he grudgingly admits Ryfel might be the one to beat Aurex.

---

## Q40: Ryfel-Kriscila Moment
**What happens:** During the festival, a drunken Kriscila pulls Ryfel aside near the estate wall and confesses her feelings—she's liked him since childhood when he saved her from Dain's bullying. 

Ryfel admits he likes her too but says they should wait three years until they're adults to be together properly. He wants to become a leader she can rely on first. To prove his sincerity, he kisses her. Elda then helps the flustered Kriscila to bed.
