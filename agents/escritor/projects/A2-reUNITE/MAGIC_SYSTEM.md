# RE:UNITE Magic System

## Core Concepts

### Ether vs Mana

**Ether**
- External ambient magical energy
- Fills the world, flows through atmosphere
- Used in newborn "Ether Ritual" to open Mana Pores
- Turquoise glowing liquid form for rituals
- Cannot be directly controlled; must be converted to internal mana

**Mana**
- Internal magical energy
- Flows beneath skin, through Mana Pores
- What mages actually manipulate
- Replenishes naturally but can be depleted
- Depletion causes exhaustion, mental fog

## The Five Elements

### 1. Earth
**Characteristics:**
- Most common, easiest to learn
- Patient but stubborn
- Requires understanding of material composition
- Most stable element

**Applications:**
- Terrain manipulation (walls, pillars, spikes)
- Soil cultivation
- Construction/repair
- Armor hardening
- Tunneling/burrowing

**Techniques:**
- Stone shaping (granite, basalt, sandstone, marble)
- Trap creation (pits, barriers)
- Multi-earth control (House Redimir specialty)
- Earthen cage (defensive)

**Physical Requirements:**
- Hand gestures: Pressing palm to ground, stomping
- Ground contact preferred
- Understanding of soil/rock composition helps control

### 2. Water
**Characteristics:**
- Trickier - must consider flow
- Healing properties
- Adaptable, fluid
- Requires understanding of currents

**Applications:**
- Irrigation
- Healing
- Ice creation (freezing)
- Steam generation (with fire)
- Mud creation (with earth)

**Techniques:**
- Stream manipulation
- Wave creation
- Freezing
- Blood manipulation (advanced)

**Limitations:**
- Limited water sources in some environments
- Freezing requires precise control

### 3. Fire
**Characteristics:**
- Most dangerous, hardest to control
- Hungry - consumes rather than moves
- Unstable, spreads easily
- Once started, difficult to stop

**Applications:**
- Heating/cooking
- Combat (flame attacks)
- Steam generation (with water)
- Light creation
- Forging (with blacksmiths)

**Techniques:**
- Controlled burns
- Fire projection
- Heat manipulation

**Limitations:**
- Can burn out of control
- Requires fuel source
- Cannot be "moved" like other elements

### 4. Air
**Characteristics:**
- Doesn't always obey
- Flows freely
- Dependent on environment
- Speed and mobility focused

**Applications:**
- Enhanced movement/jumping
- Wind attacks
- Dust/sand storms (with earth)
- Flight (advanced)
- Sound manipulation (sonic attacks)

**Techniques:**
- Wind blades
- Tornado creation
- Air pressure manipulation
- Flight/levitation

**Limitations:**
- Cannot use if wind too strong
- Requires environmental air
- Less predictable than other elements

### 5. Light
**Characteristics:**
- Rare element
- Moves in straight lines (refraction laws apply)
- Truth-revealing, purification
- Illusion creation (advanced)

**Applications:**
- Illusions (bending light)
- Purification
- Energy projection
- Mirror techniques
- Invisibility (bending light around body)

**Techniques:**
- Light refraction (illusions)
- Mirror creation
- Flashbangs (bright flashes)
- Light projection attacks
- Invisibility (Aurex's technique)

**Limitations:**
- Follows physics of light (straight lines, refraction)
- Requires light source or mana-generated light
- More complex than other elements

## Casting Mechanics

### Three Components Required

1. **Gestures**
   - Hand movements direct mana flow
   - Different elements require different gestures
   - Earth: Stomping, pressing palms
   - Water: Flowing motions
   - Fire: Sparking motions
   - Air: Twirling, directional motions
   - Light: Focusing motions

2. **Breath Control**
   - Proper breathing circulates mana
   - Tai Chi influence on technique
   - Deep breaths for major spells
   - Affects spell potency

3. **Thought/Intent**
   - Mental focus directs mana
   - Must understand element's nature
   - Earth: Cooperate with it
   - Water: Guide its flow
   - Fire: Feed it carefully
   - Air: Move with it
   - Light: Understand refraction

### Casting Process
1. Feel mana flow beneath skin
2. Direct mana through gestures
3. Shape intent through breath and thought
4. Element responds to command

## Ryfel's Innovations

### Multi-Elemental Casting

**Why Difficult:**
- Must maintain multiple mana flows simultaneously
- Each element has different "personality"
- Requires split focus
- Most mages specialize in one element

**Ryfel's Approach:**
- Scientific understanding from Earth education
- Physics knowledge (refraction, pressure, thermodynamics)
- SEAL tactical mindset (adaptation, efficiency)
- Tai Chi discipline for control

### Signature Techniques

**1. Trap-Based Warfare**
- Philosophy: "Traps never fail"
- Earth magic mines (sticky adhesive)
- Pit traps
- False floors
- Counter-trigger mechanisms

**2. Modern Military Applications**
- Flashbangs (light + sound)
- Smoke grenades
- Frag grenades
- Incendiary devices
- Sonic bombs

**3. Revolver Gauntlets**
- Mechanical + magical hybrid
- Earth/metal/fire combined bullets
- Compressed air firing mechanism
- Limited by technology level

**4. Illusion Counter-Techniques**
- Uses light refraction against light mages
- Creates own illusions
- Uses wind to clear illusion-supporting mist
- Earth sensing to detect real opponents

**5. Underground Combat**
- Tunneling for stealth
- Ambush from below
- Evasion technique
- Requires earth magic mastery

## Magic Limitations

### Physical Constraints
- **Mana Depletion:** Exhaustion, mental fog, inability to cast
- **Concentration:** Interrupting spell breaks effect
- **Physical Contact:** Earth magic requires ground contact
- **Environmental Factors:** Air magic limited by existing wind
- **Material Knowledge:** Better understanding = better control (Ryfel's advantage)

### Magical Suppression
- Prison/anti-magic fields block external mana absorption
- Internal mana can still be used but depletes quickly
- Complex spells impossible
- Physical magic (hardened body parts) may still work

### Casting Without Gestures
- Possible for simple effects
- Requires deep familiarity with spell
- Reduced potency
- Maintained concentration essential
