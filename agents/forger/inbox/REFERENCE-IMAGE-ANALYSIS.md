## ANALYSIS

**What This Appears To Be:**
An existing promotional banner/material for Elluminate (or similar team building company)

**Current Design Assessment:**
- **Messaging:** "Ignite the SPARK" — energetic, motivational
- **Visual Metaphor:** Lightbulbs = ideas, creativity, sparking new thinking
- **Color Coding:** Each service/persona has distinct color (blue=corporate, red=school/youth, green=growth/trainings)
- **Style:** Illustrative, friendly, approachable
- **Background:** Photo collage suggests real activities/events

**Strengths:**
- Clear service categories
- Energetic headline
- Friendly, inclusive imagery
- Color differentiation helps identify segments

**Potential Weaknesses (for FORGER to consider):**
- May look slightly generic/clip-art style
- Lightbulb metaphor is common/overused
- Could benefit from more modern design aesthetics
- May not convey "premium/professional" enough for corporate clients

## RECOMMENDATIONS FOR FORGER

**Option A: Elevate This Design**
Keep the structure but modernize:
- Better typography (bolder headline, better hierarchy)
- Higher quality illustrations or real photography
- More sophisticated color palette (current: bright primary colors)
- Better spacing and layout
- Add clear CTA (Call to Action)

**Option B: New Direction**
- Photography-based hero (real teams in action)
- Modern sans-serif typography
- More whitespace, cleaner aesthetic
- Service cards instead of side-by-side figures
- Video background option

**Option C: Hybrid**
- Keep "Spark" concept but execute differently
- Abstract energy/connection visuals
- Premium feel while keeping approachability

## NOTES

Caleb wants FORGER to either:
1. Recreate/improve this specific design, OR
2. Use this as inspiration for something better

FORGER should clarify which direction before starting design phase.
