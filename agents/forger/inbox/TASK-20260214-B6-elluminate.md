**Date:** 2026-02-14  
**Assigned to:** FORGER  
**Priority:** High  
**Deadline:** March 1, 2026 (flexible)

---

## PROJECT INFO
- **Project ID:** B6
- **Company Name:** Elluminate
- **Business Type:** Team building for schools/corporate/government
- **Urgency:** HIGH (active clients waiting)

---

## PURPOSE
**What this website needs to do:**
- Generate leads/contact forms from corporate/school clients
- Showcase team building activities and services
- Build credibility/trust (clients trusting us with their teams)
- Drive bookings for team building events

**Target audience:**
- HR managers (corporate)
- School administrators  
- Government event coordinators
- Problem: They need engaging team activities but don't know what works
- Action: Contact for consultation/booking

---

## MOOD & FEELING
**In 3 words:** Energetic, Professional, Transformative

**Brand personality:**
- Professional but not boring
- Energetic, shows movement/action
- Trustworthy (clients trusting us with their teams)
- Fun but results-focused

---

## DESIGN DIRECTION (CLARIFIED)

**Approach: Recreate the reference image layout with modern execution**

### Keep This Structure:
- **Hero headline:** "Ignite the SPARK within your TEAM." (or similar energetic messaging)
- **Three figures:** Corporate professional, School/youth, Training/growth personas
- **Lightbulb metaphor:** Above each figure (ideas, creativity, spark)
- **Service labels:** Corporate Teambuilding | School Programs | Overseas Retreats | Focused Trainings
- **Photo collage background:** Real activities behind the figures

### But Make It Better:
- **Typography:** Bold, modern sans-serif (Inter, Poppins, or similar)
  - Main headline: Large, impactful, maybe with "SPARK" in accent color
  - Better hierarchy and spacing
- **Illustrations:** Higher quality, more polished (not clip-art style)
  - Consistent art style across all three figures
  - More professional yet friendly
- **Colors:** 
  - Keep blue/corporate, red/school, green/training concept
  - But more sophisticated shades (not primary colors)
  - Suggested: Deep blue, coral/salmon red, forest green
- **Layout:** 
  - Better spacing and alignment
  - Clearer visual flow
  - Add CTA button below: "Get Started" or "Explore Programs"
- **Background:** 
  - Subtle photo collage of actual team building activities
  - Slightly desaturated so figures pop
- **Overall feel:** 
  - Premium but approachable
  - Corporate-ready but not boring
  - Energetic and motivational

### What to Avoid:
- Clip-art style illustrations
- Flat primary colors
- Cluttered composition
- Generic stock feel

### Deliverable:
Modern hero banner/section that keeps the "3 figures + lightbulbs" concept but looks like a $10k agency designed it.
