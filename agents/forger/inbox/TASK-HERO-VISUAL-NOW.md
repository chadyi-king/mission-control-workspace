# TASK: Create Hero Banner Visual
**Priority:** HIGH  
**Deadline:** ASAP (blocking B6 website)  
**From:** Caleb via CHAD_YI

---

## THE PROBLEM

You analyzed the reference image. You wrote a strategy doc.  
**You have NOT created the actual visual design yet.**

Caleb wants to SEE what the hero banner looks like, not read about it.

---

## WHAT YOU NEED TO CREATE

**Deliverable: Hero Banner Mockup**

Based on the reference image Caleb provided:
- 3 stylized figures side-by-side (corporate, school, training personas)
- Lightbulb above each head (blue, orange, green glow)
- Headline: "Ignite the SPARK within your TEAM"
- Service labels below: Corporate Teambuilding | School Programs | Overseas Retreats | Focused Trainings
- Background: Desaturated photo collage of team activities

**Use your design system:**
- Forest Green (#2E5C4F) as primary
- Warm Orange (#F4A261) for "SPARK" accent
- Inter font family
- Modern, premium feel (not clip-art)
