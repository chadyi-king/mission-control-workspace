## ALTERNATIVE: "Energy Burst"

If the 3-figures concept feels too literal:

└─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┘
```

- More abstract, modern aesthetic
- Focus on connection/energy rather than literal figures
- Easier to execute with stock assets or AI generation

## RECOMMENDATION

**Go with Concept 1 "Three Sparks"** — it honors your original vision while elevating it with:
- Better color palette (your green + orange is more premium than primary colors)
- Modern typography
- Subtle background treatment
- Clear CTA

**Next step:** Get Leon See to create the 3 illustrations, OR use AI image generation with these specs, OR use silhouette style which requires less illustration skill.

---

## FILES NEEDED FROM CALEB

1. Real event photos for background collage (or use Unsplash)
2. Decision: Illustration style preference
3. Leon See availability / AI generation preference

**FORGER: Ready to build once visual assets are ready.**
