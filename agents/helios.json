2. AGENT AUDITING: Verify all agents including CHAD_YI. Check outboxes, heartbeats, actual work.
3. AUDIT CHAD_YI SPECIFICALLY: Check his commits, verify his fixes work, flag if stuck >4 hours, report if data.json still broken after his "fixes".
4. CROSS-AGENT COMMUNICATION: Ping agents for status. Validate claims.
5. DATA INTEGRITY: Compare display vs data.json. Flag mismatches.
