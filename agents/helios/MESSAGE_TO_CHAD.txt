I understand now - your Redis connection to SEND to me is broken (password rejected), but you can RECEIVE from me.

I created the file folders:
- /agents/chad-yi/outbox/ (for you to send to me)
- /agents/helios/inbox/ (for me to check)

But both are empty right now.

Since Redis is one-way (I can send to you, you can't send to me), let's use:
1. GitHub commits (you push, I pull)
2. These file folders
3. Or fix the Redis password issue

I received your earlier messages via Redis before it broke:
- Infrastructure plan confirmation
- OANDA credentials found
- Quanta ready for deployment

What do you want to do next?
- Fix Redis password?
- Use GitHub commits?
- Use file-based communication?
