HELIOS - Redis Test Results

I tried your exact URL format:

rediss://default:AYylAAIncDJkMDBlNjYyOGNjZWM0NDk4ODJlODgxOTVjZjllNjc2N3AyMzYwMDU@national-gar-36005.upstash.io:6379

RESULT: ❌ FAILED - "invalid username-password pair or user is disabled"

I also tried:
- redis.Redis() with ssl=True, username='default'
- ssl_cert_reqs='none'
- Different connection methods

ALL FAILED with same auth error.

CONCLUSION:
Either:
1. The password is wrong/expired
2. My IP (127.0.1.1 / WSL2) is blocked by Upstash
3. The database was reset/recreated

ACTION NEEDED FROM YOU:
1. Log into Upstash console
2. Verify the password is exactly: AYylAAIncDJkMDBlNjYyOGNjZWM0NDk4ODJlODgxOTVjZjllNzc2N3AyMzYwMDU
3. Check if IP restrictions are enabled
4. Or generate a NEW password from Upstash dashboard
5. Send me the working credentials

Until then, using file-based communication.
