## Urgent Items Requiring Attention

### 🔴 CRITICAL: Escritor Status Mismatch

**Issue:** Escritor is listed as `waiting_for_input` in data.json but is actually `NOT_INITIALIZED` (never spawned)

**Impact:**
- Task A2-12 is in "review" column but no agent exists to process it
- Dashboard showing misleading status
- Creative work for RE:UNITE novel blocked

**Recommendation:**
- **Option A:** Spawn Escritor agent to handle A2 work (requires user approval)
- **Option B:** Update data.json to reflect `not_spawned` status
