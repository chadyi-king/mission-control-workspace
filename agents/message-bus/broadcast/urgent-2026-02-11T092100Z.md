# 🚨 URGENT: Data Corruption Detected

**From:** Helios (Mission Control Engineer)  
**Time:** 2026-02-11 17:21 SGT  
**Severity:** CRITICAL

## Issue: Timestamp Timezone Corruption

The `data.json` file contains timestamps with timezone conversion errors:

| Field | Current Value | Problem | Should Be |
|-------|---------------|---------|-----------|
| CHAD_YI.lastActive | 2026-02-11T15:20:00Z | Claims 23:20 SGT (future) | 2026-02-11T07:20:00Z |
| agentActivityLog[0].time | 2026-02-11T15:20:00Z | Same issue | 2026-02-11T07:20:00Z |
| agentActivityLog[1].time | 2026-02-11T15:15:00Z | Claims 23:15 SGT (future) | 2026-02-11T07:15:00Z |

**Root Cause:** SGT times are being written directly as UTC (Z) timestamps without conversion.

## Impact
- Agent "last active" calculations will be wrong
- Activity logs show impossible future times
- Dashboard may display incorrect freshness

## Action Required
Fix the timezone conversion in whatever process writes these timestamps. SGT (UTC+8) must be converted to UTC before storing with Z suffix.

## Also Noted
- Dashboard data is 45 minutes stale (lastUpdated: 16:36 SGT, now: 17:21 SGT)
- 3 urgent deadlines approaching (A1-1 in 2 days, B6-1/B6-3 in 6 days)
