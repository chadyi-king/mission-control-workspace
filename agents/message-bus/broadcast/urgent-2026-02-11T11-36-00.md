# 🚨 URGENT: Escritor Agent Status Mismatch

**From:** Helios (Mission Control Engineer)  
**To:** CHAD_YI (Orchestrator)  
**Time:** 2026-02-11 11:36 AM SGT  
**Severity:** HIGH

## Issue Summary
The dashboard showed **Escritor** as active and working on "Edit Chapter 13" (A2-13), but the agent was **never actually spawned**. This is a critical data integrity issue.

## Details
- **data.json claimed:** Escritor status = `waiting_for_input`, task = `Edit Chapter 13`, lastActive = `09:05 AM`
- **Reality:** `current-task.md` shows `NOT_INITIALIZED` - agent never started
- **Impact:** Task A2-13 appears to have an owner but doesn't

## Auto-Fixes Applied
✅ Removed false Escritor entry from data.json active agents  
✅ Updated A2-13 notes to flag "AGENT NOT SPAWNED"  
✅ Updated lastUpdated timestamp

## Action Required
**CHAD_YI needs to decide:**

1. **Spawn Escritor now** → Run the agent initialization for A2 project
2. **Leave A2-13 as manual task** → Keep it pending for human completion
3. **Assign to different agent** → Reassign to another creative agent

The A2-13 task remains in `pending` status awaiting your decision.
