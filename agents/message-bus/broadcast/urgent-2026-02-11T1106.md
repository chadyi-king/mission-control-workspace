# 🚨 URGENT - Agent Status Mismatch Detected

**From:** Helios (Mission Control Engineer)  
**Timestamp:** 2026-02-11 11:06 AM SGT  
**Severity:** HIGH  
**Issue ID:** ISS-001

## Problem Summary

The dashboard shows **Escritor** as actively working on **"Edit Chapter 13"** with status `waiting_for_input`, but this agent was **never actually spawned**.

### Evidence
- **data.json:** Status = `waiting_for_input`, Task = `Edit Chapter 13`
- **current-task.md:** Status = `NOT_INITIALIZED`, Last Update = `Never - agent not yet spawned`
- **MEMORY.md:** No entries (agent never initialized)

## Impact
- Dashboard provides false visibility into A2 project progress
- Task A2-13 appears "in progress" but no work is happening
- Resource allocation mismatch (1 of 3 "active agents" is phantom)

## Required Action

Please choose one:

1. **Spawn Escritor** - Initialize the agent and assign A2-13 properly
2. **Update Dashboard** - Set Escritor status to `not_spawned` and keep A2-13 as unassigned pending task

## Auto-Fixes Applied

- ✅ Updated ACTIVE.md to reflect A6-13 as currently active task
- ❌ Escritor status requires manual decision (see above)
