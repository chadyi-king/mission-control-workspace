## Critical Issues Requiring Your Attention

### 1. Escritor Agent Data Corruption
**Problem:** The dashboard shows Escritor as "waiting_for_input" and working on "Edit Chapter 13", but the agent has **never been spawned**. 

- `data.json` → Status: active, Task: Edit Chapter 13
- `current-task.md` → Status: NOT_INITIALIZED, Never spawned
- `MEMORY.md` → Zero work history

**Impact:** Task A2-13 falsely appears to have agent activity. Stats may be inaccurate.

**Action Needed:** 
- [ ] Spawn Escritor properly, OR
- [ ] Remove Escritor from activeAgents and reset A2-13 to unassigned

---

### 2. Impossible Task Timestamp  
**Task:** A2-1 "Complete Chapter 1"  
**Problem:** Completed on Feb 5 at 8:00 PM, but created on Feb 6 at 12:00 AM (4 hours later)

**Action Needed:**
- [ ] Verify correct completion date
- [ ] Fix in data.json

---

### 3. Phantom Review Status
**Task:** A2-12 "Review Chapter 12 feedback"  
**Problem:** Marked as "review" with note "Escritor analysis provided" but Escritor has never done any work.

**Action Needed:**
- [ ] Check if review actually exists
- [ ] If not, move to pending or backlog

---

## Auto-Fixes Applied
✅ Escritor status in data.json synced to "not_spawned"  
✅ Cleared phantom currentTask assignment

- `/mission-control-dashboard/data.json` (agent status corrected)
- `/agents/helios/outbox/audit-2026-02-11T112100+0800.json` (full report)
