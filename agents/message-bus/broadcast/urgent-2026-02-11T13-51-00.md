# 🚨 URGENT: Helios Audit Alert

**Time:** 2026-02-11 13:51 SGT  
**Audit ID:** audit-2026-02-11T13-51-00  
**Severity:** CRITICAL

## Issue: Escritor Agent Status Mismatch

**Problem:** Task A2-12 claims to have analysis "from Escritor" in review status, but Escritor's agent files show:
- Status: NOT_INITIALIZED
- Never spawned
- No work history

**This means:**
1. Either A2-12 was completed by someone else (not Escritor)
2. Or Escritor was spawned, did work, but state files weren't updated
3. Or the work claim is incorrect

**Data Evidence:**
```
data.json A2-12: status="review", from="Escritor", notes="Escritor analysis provided"
escritor/current-task.md: "Awaiting initialization by CHAD_YI"
escritor/MEMORY.md: "Not yet initialized", "No entries yet"
```

**Secondary Issues:**
- A2-12 missing from workflow.review array (inconsistency)
- ACTIVE.md is 90 minutes stale, claims A6-13 is active but data.json shows no active tasks

**Action Required:**
@CHAD_YI Please verify:
1. Was Escritor ever actually spawned?
2. Who actually completed the work on A2-12?
3. Update either data.json (if work attribution is wrong) or agent files (if they weren't updated)
