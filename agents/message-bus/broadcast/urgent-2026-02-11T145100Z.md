## 🚨 Issues Requiring Your Decision

### 1. A6-13 Status Mismatch (Medium Priority)

**Problem:** ACTIVE.md and data.json disagree on task status.

- **ACTIVE.md** shows: A6-13 "Project Detail Page" as **Active Task**
- **data.json** shows: A6-13 status = **"backlog"**, workflow.active is **empty**

**Question for CHAD_YI:** Is A6-13 actually in progress, or is ACTIVE.md outdated?

**Action needed:**
- If truly active → Update data.json: `tasks["A6-13"].status = "active"` and add to `workflow.active`
- If not started → Update ACTIVE.md to remove from Active Tasks section

---

### 2. A2-12 Status Inconsistency (Medium Priority)

**Problem:** Task status disagreement between dashboard and agent state.

- **data.json** shows: A2-12 status = **"backlog"**, notes say "Escritor analysis of Chapter 12 provided"
- **escritor/AGENT_STATE.json** shows: assignedTask = "A2-12", taskStatus = **"review"**

**Question for CHAD_YI:** Did Escritor actually provide Chapter 12 analysis?

**Action needed:**
- If analysis was provided → Move A2-12 to `workflow.review` in data.json
- If not provided → Update escritor/AGENT_STATE.json to clear assignedTask

---

### 3. Escritor Status Terminology (Low Priority)

**Problem:** Three different terms for same state.

- data.json: "waiting_for_input"
- AGENT_STATE.json: "not_spawned"  
- current-task.md: "NOT_INITIALIZED"

**Recommendation:** Standardize on "not_spawned" for configured-but-never-spawned agents.
