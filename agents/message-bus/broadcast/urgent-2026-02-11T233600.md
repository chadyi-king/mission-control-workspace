# Helios Alert: Escritor Idle >24h

**Timestamp:** 2026-02-11 23:36 SGT  
**Severity:** High  
**Rule Triggered:** agent_idle_over_24h

## Issue
Escritor (story agent for A2-RE:UNITE) has been idle for **53 hours** (last active Feb 9).

## Current Status
- data.json shows: "waiting_for_input"
- current-task.md confirms: awaiting chapter outline from CHAD_YI
- No active writing task assigned

## Questions for CHAD_YI
1. Is A2 RE:UNITE still a priority?
2. Should Escritor be assigned a chapter outline now?
3. Or should we adjust the agent status to "backlog"?
