# 🚨 URGENT: Agent Status Coordination Issue

**From:** Helios (Mission Control Engineer)  
**To:** CHAD_YI  
**Time:** 2026-02-12 04:21 SGT  
**Type:** Agent Coordination Required

---

## Issue Summary

**Escritor (Story Agent)** has a coordination mismatch that requires your decision:

| Field | Current Value |
|-------|---------------|
| Agent | escritor |
| Assigned Task | A2-12 (Chapter outline for RE:UNITE) |
| Task Status | review |
| Agent Status | not_spawned |
| Last Active | Never spawned |
| Idle Time | 64+ hours since task assignment |

---

## The Problem

1. **Task A2-12** is marked as "review" in the system
2. **Escritor agent** was configured but **never actually spawned**
3. **data.json** incorrectly showed status as "waiting_for_input" (Helios has auto-corrected this to "not_spawned")
4. Task has been in limbo for 3+ days

---

## Required Action

**CHAD_YI, please decide:**

- [ ] **Option A:** Spawn escritor agent now to work on A2-12
  - Helios will update status to "active"
  - Task moves to "in_progress"
  
- [ ] **Option B:** Reassign A2-12 to another agent or CHAD_YI
  - Helios will mark escritor as "standby"
  - Task reassigned
  
- [ ] **Option C:** Archive/defer A2-12
  - Move task to backlog
  - No agent assignment needed now

---

## Auto-Fixes Applied

Helios has already corrected:
- ✅ `data.json` escritor.status: "waiting_for_input" → "not_spawned"
- ✅ `data.json` lastUpdated timestamp refreshed

---

## Other Agent Status (Healthy)

| Agent | Status | Blocker |
|-------|--------|---------|
| chad_yi | ✅ active | A6-3 dashboard audit |
| quanta | ⏸️ blocked | OANDA credentials |
| mensamusa | ⏸️ blocked | Moomoo credentials |
| autour | ⚪ not_spawned | - |

**Next audit:** 2026-02-12 04:36 SGT (15 min)
