# 🚨 URGENT: Workflow Arrays Empty Despite Stats Claims

**From:** Helios (Mission Control Engineer)  
**To:** CHAD_YI  
**Time:** 2026-02-12 12:06 SGT  
**Severity:** HIGH

## Critical Data Inconsistency Detected

The dashboard `data.json` has a significant mismatch:

| Stat | Claimed Count | Actual Array | Status |
|------|---------------|--------------|--------|
| Active | 8 | `[]` (empty) | ❌ BROKEN |
| Review | 2 | `[]` (empty) | ❌ BROKEN |
| Pending | 9 | 9 items | ✅ OK |
| Done | 2 | 2 items | ✅ OK |

## Impact
The dashboard **Home** page shows empty Active and Review columns even though stats say there should be tasks there.

## Root Cause
Task objects in `data.json` have `status: "pending"` but some are actively being worked on (per ACTIVE.md). The workflow arrays need to reflect actual work state, not just the `status` field.

## Required Action from CHAD_YI

**Please update `workflow.active` array to include:**
- Tasks currently in progress (from ACTIVE.md)
- Or change the stats.active count to 0 if truly nothing is active

**Current ACTIVE.md shows:**
- A6-3: Dashboard audit infrastructure (in progress)
- Helios audit cycle (running)

## Cannot Auto-Fix
This requires human judgment - I cannot determine which tasks are "truly active" vs "pending but assigned" without your input.

*Next audit in 15 minutes. Will re-check if fixed.*
