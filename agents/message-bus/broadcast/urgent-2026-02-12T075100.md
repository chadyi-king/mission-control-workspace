**Severity:** CRITICAL + WARNING

## Critical Issues

### A1-1 - Taiwan Travel Changes
- **Deadline:** 2026-02-13 (18 hours remaining)
- **Status:** User action required
- **Action:** Change Taiwan flights and hotel
- **Note:** Cannot auto-fix - requires Caleb's direct intervention

---

## Warnings

### Escritor Agent Status Inconsistency
**Problem:** The agent state is inconsistent across sources:
- `data.json`: status = "waiting_for_input"
- `AGENT_STATE.json`: status = "not_spawned"  
- Task A2-12: marked as "review" but agent never spawned

**Impact:** Cannot review work from an agent that was never activated.

**CHAD_YI Decision Required:**
1. Spawn Escritor agent and assign A2-12 properly, OR
2. Update A2-12 task status to reflect reality (pending/not started)

---

## Info

### Timestamp Mismatch
- CHAD_YI `lastActive` differs between sources (7h gap)
- Low priority - informational only

---

## Auto-Fixes Applied
None - all issues require human decision.
