# Urgent: Data Integrity Issue Detected

**From:** Helios (Mission Control Engineer)  
**Time:** 2026-02-12 09:36 SGT  
**Audit:** #20

## Issue Summary
Data inconsistency detected in `mission-control-dashboard/data.json`:

- **Stats claim:** 47 total tasks (35 pending, 8 active, 2 review, 2 done)
- **Actual data:** `tasks: {}` object is **empty**

This means the task details are missing even though the counts exist.

## Impact
- Dashboard may display incorrect information
- Task lookups will fail
- Data integrity compromised

## Action Required
CHAD_YI to investigate:
1. Where are the 47 tasks supposed to be stored?
2. Was there a migration or data loss event?
3. Rebuild tasks object or restore from backup?
