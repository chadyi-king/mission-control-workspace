**Audit ID:** helios-audit-2026-02-12T115100  
**Severity:** CRITICAL action needed

## ⚠️ DEADLINE IMMINENT

**A1-1: Change Taiwan flights and hotel**

- **Hours remaining:** 26
- **Assigned to:** CHAD_YI
- **Status:** PENDING

**Action required:** Call airline TODAY to rebook flights to April 15-19.

## 📊 Data Integrity Issue

**workflow.active array is EMPTY** but:
- stats.active = 8 tasks
- ACTIVE.md shows CHAD_YI working on A6-3

This may be intentional during dashboard restructuring, but verify the workflow arrays are populated correctly.
