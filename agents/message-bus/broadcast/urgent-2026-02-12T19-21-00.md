## 🟡 DATA INCONSISTENCY: B6-4 Task Structure

**Issue:** Task B6-4 has inconsistent data structure between arrays

**Problem:**
- In `urgentDeadlines` array: Has complete fields
- In `tasks` object: Missing standard fields (id, category, status, agent)
- Only has: brief, whatINeed, why, steps, currentStatus, deadline, priority, project

**Impact:** Dashboard may not render this task correctly

**Recommended Fix:**
Standardize B6-4 to match other task objects:
```json
{
  "id": "B6-4",
  "title": "MENDAKI Program Flow & Scavenger Hunt Brief",
  "category": "B6",
  "priority": "HIGH",
  "status": "pending",
  "deadline": "2026-02-13",
  "agent": "CHAD_YI",
  "description": "Create program flow for facilitators, timeline, and scavenger hunt brief for MENDAKI event"
}
```
