# URGENT: B6-4 Task Structure Malformed

**Audit ID:** audit-2026-02-12T195100+0800  
**Timestamp:** 2026-02-12 19:51 SGT  
**Severity:** CRITICAL  

## Issue Summary

Task B6-4 has a non-standard structure that breaks dashboard consistency.

## Problems Found

1. **Missing Standard Fields:**
   - `id` (should be "B6-4")
   - `status` (should be "pending")
   - `createdAt` (ISO timestamp)
   - `updatedAt` (ISO timestamp)
   - `agent` (currently unassigned)

2. **Non-Standard Fields Present:**
   - `brief` → should be `description`
   - `whatINeed` → not part of standard schema
   - `why` → not part of standard schema  
   - `steps` → not part of standard schema
   - `currentStatus` → should be `status`

3. **Deadline Format Issue:**
   - Current: "Feb 13" (string)
   - Required: "2026-02-13" (ISO date)

## Impact

- Task may not render correctly in dashboard
- Breaks data consistency across the system
- Task is due in 17 hours (Feb 13) and is UNASSIGNED

## Suggested Fix

Restructure B6-4 to match standard task format:

```json
"B6-4": {
  "id": "B6-4",
  "title": "MENDAKI Program Flow & Scavenger Hunt Brief",
  "category": "B6",
  "priority": "HIGH",
  "status": "pending",
  "deadline": "2026-02-13",
  "agent": "CHAD_YI",
  "description": "Create program flow for facilitators, timeline, and scavenger hunt brief for MENDAKI event. Complete facilitator guide, event timeline, and scavenger hunt logistics.",
  "createdAt": "2026-02-12T17:00:00+08:00",
  "updatedAt": "2026-02-12T19:51:00+08:00"
}
```

## Auto-Fixes Applied

- ✅ Added B6-4 to workflow.pending array
- ✅ Updated ACTIVE.md with current timestamp

## Action Required

**Manual fix needed:** Standardize B6-4 task structure before deadline (17 hours remaining).
