## ⚠️ Critical Issue Requiring Action

### B6-4: Orphaned Workflow Entry

**Problem:** Task B6-4 exists in `workflow.pending` array but has no corresponding entry in the `tasks` object.

**Impact:** Dashboard JavaScript will crash when trying to render details for a non-existent task.

**Evidence:**
- workflow.pending contains: `["B6-4"]`
- tasks["B6-4"] = undefined

**Options:**
1. Create the missing B6-4 task in data.json
2. Remove B6-4 from workflow.pending

**Recommendation:** Check ACTIVE.md - it mentions B6-4 as "MENDAKI Program Flow & Scavenger Hunt Brief" due Feb 13. This might be a legitimate task that needs to be created.

## 📋 Other Issues (Auto-fixable)

1. **A2-13 Status Mismatch** - Escritor actively working but task shows "backlog"
2. **Workflow Arrays Incomplete** - Missing pending/active entries
3. **Stats/Workflow Sync** - review/done arrays empty despite stats showing 2 each

These can be auto-fixed on next audit cycle if enabled.
