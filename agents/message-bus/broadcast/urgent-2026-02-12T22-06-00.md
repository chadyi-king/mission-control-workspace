- **Status:** Marked as pending but appears in active workflow
- **Action:** User action required - rebook flights/hotel to April 15-19

---

## ⚠️ WARNINGS (Data Inconsistency)

### 1. Stats vs Workflow Mismatch
```
Stats claim:    pending=7, active=8, review=2, done=2
Workflow shows: pending=1, active=7, review=0, done=0
```

### 2. Task Status Mismatches
These tasks are in `workflow.active` but have status="backlog":
- A2-13 (Escritor's study phase)
- A5-1 (Quanta - trading bot)
- A5-2 (MensaMusa - options flow)

### 3. Missing Task
- A6-3 is in workflow.active but doesn't exist in tasks object

### 4. B6-4 Misplaced
- In workflow.pending but status is "backlog" (not "pending")

---

## ✅ VERIFIED (No Issues)

- **Escritor:** Current task matches actual work (A2-13 Study Phase)
- **data.json:** Freshly updated (22:04 SGT)
- **Agents:** All statuses consistent with their files

---

## 📋 Recommended Actions

1. **Fix A1-1** - Address Taiwan flight changes (due tomorrow)
2. **Sync workflow arrays** with actual task statuses
3. **Create A6-3** task record or remove from workflow
4. **Update B6-4** status to "pending" or move to backlog array
