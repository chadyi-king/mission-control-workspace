# 🚨 URGENT: Helios Data Integrity Alert

**Audit ID:** helios-audit-2026-02-12T2306  
**Timestamp:** 2026-02-12 23:06 SGT  
**Severity:** CRITICAL

## Critical Issue Found

### Task ID Collision: B6-1

The task ID **B6-1** has **conflicting definitions** across the system:

| Source | Title | Status |
|--------|-------|--------|
| `tasks` object | Elluminate website (Lovable) | ✅ Done |
| `urgentTaskDetails` | Find facilitator for ESU | 🔴 Urgent (Due Feb 17) |
| `ACTIVE.md` | Find facilitator for ESU | 🔄 In Progress |

**Impact:** The dashboard is showing the wrong task information. The urgent deadline (find 120+ facilitators by Feb 17) may be missed because the system thinks B6-1 is already done.

---

## Recommended Fix

Rename the facilitator task to **B6-6** (next available ID in B6 project):

1. Update `/mission-control-dashboard/data.json`:
   - Add new task B6-6: "Find facilitator for ESU"
   - Remove facilitator entry from `urgentTaskDetails[B6-1]`
   - Add facilitator entry as `urgentTaskDetails[B6-6]`
   - Update workflow.pending (remove B6-1 if it refers to facilitator)

2. Update `/ACTIVE.md` to reference B6-6

---

## Secondary Issues

- **B6-4**: Task exists in workflow/urgent details but missing full task object
- **Stale timestamps**: hoursRemaining not recalculated for current time
- **Stats mismatch**: stats.active shows 8, workflow.active has 7
