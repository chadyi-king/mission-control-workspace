**Audit ID:** helios-audit-2026-02-12T2351  
**Time:** 2026-02-12 23:51 SGT  
**Severity:** Medium (no critical issues)

---

## Summary

Found **3 warnings** requiring manual attention. Auto-fixes blocked by configuration.

---

## ⚠️ Issues Found

### 1. Workflow/Task Status Mismatch (Medium)
**Problem:** The `workflow.pending` and `workflow.active` arrays don't match actual task statuses.

- Workflow says: 2 pending, 7 active
- Reality: 65 pending, 3 active
- Many tasks listed in `workflow.active` have `status: "pending"` in their task objects

**Action Required:** Sync workflow arrays with actual task statuses

---

### 2. A1-1 Title Mismatch (Low)
**Problem:** Different titles in different places
- Task object: "Plan weekly schedule"
- urgentTaskDetails: "Change Taiwan flights and hotel"

**Action Required:** Clarify correct title and update both locations

---

### 3. Missing Task B6-4 (Low)
**Problem:** B6-4 referenced in urgentTaskDetails but doesn't exist in tasks object

**Action Required:** Create B6-4 or remove from urgent list
