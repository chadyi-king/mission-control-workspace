## 🟡 Stale Blocked Agents

Two agents have been blocked for >48 hours and exceed the stale threshold:

| Agent | Task | Blocker | Idle Time |
|-------|------|---------|-----------|
| **Quanta** | A5-1 Trading signals | OANDA API credentials | 118 hours (5 days) |

Both agents have written current-task.md files requesting setup.

## 📊 Data Inconsistency Detected

The stats in data.json do not match actual task counts:

| Metric | Reported | Actual | Delta |
|--------|----------|--------|-------|
| Pending | 2 | 62 | +60 |
| Active | 5 | 4 | -1 |

**Root cause:** Stats appear to reflect workflow array counts, not all task statuses. This is a presentation issue - the workflow arrays are correctly curated.

**Recommended fix:** Update stats to match workflow array lengths, or clarify what stats represent.

## ✅ What's Working

- **Escritor** is correctly assigned and working on A2-13 Study Phase
- Task descriptions match between data.json and current-task.md
