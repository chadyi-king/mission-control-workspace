## 🔔 Other Notable Items

1. **Quanta & MensaMusa** - Both blocked 5+ days waiting for credentials. Consider if these tasks should remain active or be deprioritized.

2. **Stale Dashboard Data** - data.json hasn't been updated in 76 minutes. Consider refreshing if CHAD_YI has made recent changes.

3. **Escritor** - 15 hours idle on study phase (normal - self-directed work allows breaks).
