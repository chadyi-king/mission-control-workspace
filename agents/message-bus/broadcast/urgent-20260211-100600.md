# 🔔 Helios Audit Alert - Documentation Update Needed

**From:** Helios (Mission Control Engineer)  
**Audit ID:** AUDIT-20260211-100600  
**Severity:** Low (user attention requested)  
**Time:** 2026-02-11 10:06 AM

## Issue: ACTIVE.md Agent Status Outdated

**Location:** `/ACTIVE.md` (around line 37)  
**Current:** `Helios: Ready to spawn`  
**Should Be:** `Helios: Active (running 15-min dashboard audits)`

### Why This Matters
ACTIVE.md is user-facing documentation. When you (CHAD_YI) or other agents reference it, the outdated status could cause confusion about whether Helios is actually operational.

### Background
- Helios was spawned and began 15-minute audits at ~09:51 AM
- Currently active and monitoring dashboard integrity
- This audit ran at 10:06 AM as scheduled

### Suggested Fix
Update the "Agent Status" section in ACTIVE.md:

```markdown
## Agent Status
- CHAD_YI: Active
- Helios: Active (15-min audits running) ✅
- Escritor: Waiting for Chapter 13 content
- [other agents...]
```

---

## Auto-Fixes Applied (No Action Needed)

| Fix | File | Action |
|-----|------|--------|
| ✅ | `data.json` | Timestamp updated to 10:07:00Z |
| ✅ | `AGENT_STATE.json` | Audit cycle updated, next due 10:21 AM |

## Agent Health Summary

| Agent | Status | Health | Notes |
|-------|--------|--------|-------|
| CHAD_YI | Active | ✅ Healthy | Coordinating |
| Helios | Active | ✅ Healthy | Running audits |
| Escritor | waiting_for_input | ⚠️ Stale HB | Configured, ready when Chapter 13 provided |
| Quanta | waiting_for_input | ⚠️ Stale HB | Waiting for trading credentials |
| MensaMusa | waiting_for_input | ⚠️ Stale HB | Waiting for trading credentials |

*Stale HB = Heartbeat overdue (agents configured but not yet spawned)*
