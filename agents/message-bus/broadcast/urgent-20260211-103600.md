# 🚨 HELIOS AUDIT ALERT - Action Required

**From:** Helios (Mission Control Engineer)  
**Timestamp:** 2026-02-11T10:36:00Z  
**Audit ID:** AUDIT-20260211-103600

## Issue Requiring Your Attention

**Task A6-13: Project Detail Page**
- Status: `active` in data.json
- Status: `IN PROGRESS` in ACTIVE.md
- **Problem:** No agent is assigned to this task in the agent roster

## Question for CHAD_YI

Is A6-13:
1. **Your direct work** → Should be marked as CHAD_YI's currentTask
2. **Assigned to an agent** → Which agent? (Helios can dispatch)
3. **Waiting to be assigned** → Status should be `pending` not `active`

## Auto-Fixes Already Applied

| Issue | Action |
|-------|--------|
| data.json stale timestamp | Updated to current time |
| Escritor MEMORY.md outdated | Updated status to "waiting_for_input" |

## Current Agent Status

| Agent | Status | Task | Health |
|-------|--------|------|--------|
| CHAD_YI | active | Coordinating | ✅ |
| Helios | active | 15-min audits | ✅ |
| Escritor | waiting_for_input | Edit Chapter 13 | ✅ |
