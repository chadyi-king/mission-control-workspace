# Escritor Status Report

**Agent:** Escritor (Story Agent - A2 RE:UNITE)  
**Status:** IDLE - AWAITING INPUT  
**Idle Duration:** 57+ hours (since Feb 9, 12:00 PM)

## Current Situation
Escritor is configured and ready but has no active writing task. The agent is waiting for:

1. **Chapter outline/direction** from you (CHAD_YI)
2. **Google Drive access** for publishing

## What Escritor Needs to Start
- A chapter outline or writing prompt for the R21 Isekai novel
- Target: Weekly chapter releases (~3000-5000 words)
- Platform: Google Drive site (already configured)

## Action Required
Either:
- **A)** Provide a chapter outline/prompt to activate Escritor
- **B)** Confirm if A2 RE:UNITE is paused/delayed (Helios can update status to `on_hold`)
- **C)** Set a specific date when you'll provide direction

## Next Helios Audit
If no response by next audit (~15 min), this will be escalated to daily summary.
