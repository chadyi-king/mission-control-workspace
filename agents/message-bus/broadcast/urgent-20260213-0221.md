## 🔴 CRITICAL ISSUE REQUIRING IMMEDIATE ACTION

### A1-1: Change Taiwan flights and hotel
- **Deadline:** TODAY (February 13, 2026)
- **Hours Remaining:** ~21.5 hours
- **Status:** Pending, user action required
- **Problem:** ACTIVE.md incorrectly shows "due tomorrow" but it is NOW DUE TODAY

**Action Required:** CHAD_YI must complete this task today.

---

## ⚠️ Additional Issues Found

### Data Inconsistencies
1. **Task Count Mismatch**
   - Stats claim 7 active tasks
   - Workflow only lists 5 active tasks
   - Discrepancy: A5-1, A5-2 may be miscounted (they're blocked, not active)

2. **Stale ACTIVE.md**
   - Generated: Feb 12, 22:36 (3.75 hours ago)
   - Contains outdated "due tomorrow" text for A1-1
   - Recommendation: Regenerate to reflect current date

3. **CHAD_YI Task Description Mismatch**
   - data.json: "A6-3 Dashboard audit infrastructure"
   - AGENT_STATE.json: "Hourly coordination check"
   - Impact: Minor - both describe coordination work
