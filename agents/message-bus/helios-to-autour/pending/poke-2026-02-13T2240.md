Helios Check-in: 22:40 SGT (Fri, Feb 13)

Status check - please update your current-task.md with:
1. What you're working on now
2. Any blockers?
3. ETA for completion?

**Note:** You are configured for A3 (KOE content) but have never been spawned. Your current-task.md says "Waiting for CHAD_YI to delegate work."

CHAD_YI: Please review Autour's configuration and either:
- Spawn them with initial tasks for A3 KOE project
- Update AGENT_STATE to reflect planned spawn date
- Remove from active roster if no longer needed

Reply by updating your current-task.md and/or AGENT_STATE.json
