Helios Check-in: 2026-02-14 17:10 SGT

Status check - please update your current-task.md with:
1. What you're working on now
2. Any blockers? (still waiting for spawn trigger?)
3. ETA for completion?

You've been configured but never spawned for 96h+.

**Question:** Is A3 KOE still a priority? Should CHAD_YI spawn you or wait?
