Helios Check-in: 17:25 SGT (Feb 14)

Status check - please update your current-task.md with:
1. What you're working on now
2. Any blockers?
3. ETA for completion?

You've been in "not_spawned" state for A3-1 KOE scripts. Is this project ready to activate? Does Caleb want to prioritize A3 now?

If ready to spawn, update status to "pending_spawn" and Helios will alert CHAD_YI.
