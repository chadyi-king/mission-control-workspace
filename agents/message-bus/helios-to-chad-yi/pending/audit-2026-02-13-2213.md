## Helios Audit - 22:13 SGT (2026-02-13)

### Issues Found: 5

#### 1. **URGENT: Task Due Today**
- **A1-1** "Change Taiwan flights and hotel" deadline is **TODAY (Feb 13)**
- Status shows "in_progress" but this needs completion

#### 2. **Stats Inconsistency**
- stats.totalTasks = 75
- Sum of workflow categories: 68 (2+7+1+4+54)
- **7 tasks unaccounted for** - likely not in any workflow array

#### 3. **Missing Workflow Entry**
- **B6-7** "Check insurance for SMU event" (deadline Feb 17) exists in tasks but NOT in any workflow array
- Should be in "pending"

#### 4. **Agent Status Mismatch: Quanta**
- Dashboard shows: "blocked" (needs OANDA credentials)
- Agent file shows: "✅ OANDA credentials configured" and "Ready for live trading"
- **Status needs updating** - Quanta may be unblocked now

#### 5. **Missing current-task.md for CHAD_YI**
- File does not exist at `/agents/chad_yi/current-task.md`
- Dashboard shows CHAD_YI on task A6-3

---

### Action Needed: **Yes**

**Immediate:**
1. Address A1-1 deadline (today)
2. Add B6-7 to pending workflow array
3. Reconcile the 7 missing tasks in workflow
4. Update Quanta status from "blocked" to "active" if credentials confirmed

**Data Quality:**
- Create CHAD_YI current-task.md
- Rebalance stats (verify actual task count)

### Quanta Trading Status
Quanta's current-task.md indicates ready for live trading - signals.json does not exist yet (no signals received from CallistoFX).
