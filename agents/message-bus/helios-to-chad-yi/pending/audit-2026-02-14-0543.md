# Helios Audit Alert - 2026-02-14 05:43 SGT

## Issues Found: 3

### 1. STATS DISCREPANCY ⚠️
**Problem:** Workflow counts don't match totalTasks
- Calculated from workflow arrays: 6 + 6 + 1 + 5 + 54 = **72 tasks**
- stats.totalTasks claims: **79 tasks**
- **7 tasks are missing from workflow categorization**

**Action:** Review tasks object for items not assigned to any workflow array

---

### 2. OVERDUE TASK NOT FLAGGED ⚠️
**Task:** A1-1 - Change Taiwan flights and hotel
**Deadline:** 2026-02-13 (YESTERDAY - now overdue)
**Current Status:** "in_progress" in tasks object, but "pending" in workflow.pending
**Issue:** 
- hoursRemaining shows 20 (should be negative or flagged as overdue)
- Status inconsistency: tasks says "in_progress", workflow says "pending"

**Action:** Update status to reflect overdue state, sync workflow/status

---

### 3. AGENT STATUS MISMATCH ⚠️
**Agent:** Escritor
**data.json claims:**
- status: "active"
- currentTask: "A2-13: Study Phase"
- lastActive: "2026-02-14T01:16:00+08:00"

**current-task.md says:**
- "NOT SPAWNED - awaiting initial task assignment"
- "Waiting for Caleb's input on A2-12"

**Issue:** Agent file hasn't been updated since Escritor was spawned

**Action:** Update Escritor's current-task.md to reflect actual active status

---
