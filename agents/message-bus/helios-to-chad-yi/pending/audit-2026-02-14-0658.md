**Interval:** 15-minute dashboard audit

### Issues Found: 4

#### 🔴 CRITICAL: Task A1-1 OVERDUE

| Field | Value |
|-------|-------|
| Task | A1-1: Change Taiwan flights and hotel |
| Deadline | Feb 13, 2026 (yesterday) |
| Current Date | Feb 14, 2026 |
| Status | Overdue by 1 day |
| Assigned | CHAD_YI |
| Notes | Caleb handling personally |

**Problem:** This task was due yesterday but is still showing as "in_progress" and sitting in the pending workflow array. The dashboard shows it as "urgent" but it should be flagged as OVERDUE.

#### 🟡 Stats Inconsistency

```
stats.totalTasks:     79
Actual in tasks{}:    ~72 tasks
Workflow sum:         18 (6 pending + 6 active + 1 review + 5 done)
Calculated backlog:   79 - 18 = 61
stats.backlog shows:  54
Discrepancy:          7 tasks unaccounted for
```

```
stats.urgent:         3
urgentTaskDetails:    4 entries (A1-1, A1-4, B6-6, B6-3)
Discrepancy:          Count mismatch
```

#### 🟡 Agent Status Mismatch

| Agent | data.json Status | current-task.md Status |
|-------|------------------|------------------------|
| Escritor | active, task A2-13 | NOT SPAWNED |
| Quanta | blocked, idle 120h | NOT SPAWNED |
| MensaMusa | blocked, idle 120h | NOT SPAWNED |

**Issue:** Agent files say they're not spawned, but data.json treats them as active agents with task assignments.

#### 🟡 Missing Agent Files

- `/agents/chad_yi/current-task.md` - not found
- `/agents/helios/current-task.md` - not found

### Recommended Actions

1. **Immediate:** Address A1-1 Taiwan flights - overdue task
2. **Fix:** Update A1-1 status to "overdue" or mark as done if completed
3. **Fix:** Reconcile stats.totalTasks with actual task count
4. **Fix:** Sync agent status between data.json and current-task.md files
5. **Create:** Add missing current-task.md files for chad_yi and helios
