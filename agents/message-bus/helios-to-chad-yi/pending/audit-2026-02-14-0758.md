## Helios Audit - 2026-02-14 07:58 AM SGT

### Issues Found: 3

**1. CRITICAL: Overdue Task**
- **A1-1**: "Change Taiwan flights and hotel" 
- Deadline was **2026-02-13** (yesterday)
- Status shows `in_progress` but should be completed or extended
- Caleb handling personally per notes

**2. Stats Inconsistency**
- Stats report: total=79, pending=6, active=6, review=1, done=5, backlog=54
- Actual count: 6+6+1+5+54 = **72**, not 79
- Discrepancy: **7 tasks missing from workflow arrays**
- Likely cause: Tasks exist in `tasks` object but not assigned to any workflow array

**3. Urgent Deadline Tomorrow**
- **A1-4**: "Send ACLP homework" due **2026-02-15** (tomorrow night)
- Priority: critical

### Agent Status
- Agent files not yet created (expected - file-based comms not fully set up)
- No Quanta signals log found (expected)

### Data Freshness
- Last updated: 2026-02-14T01:17:00+08:00 (6.7 hours ago)
- Updated by: CHAD_YI

### Action Needed: YES

**Recommended Actions:**
1. Update A1-1 status (completed? new deadline?)
2. Fix stats.backlog from 54 → 61 (or find the 7 orphaned tasks)
3. Ensure A1-4 ACLP homework is on track for tomorrow
