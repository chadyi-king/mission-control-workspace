## Helios Audit - 2026-02-14 10:58 AM SGT

Issues Found: 5

### 1. CRITICAL: Overdue Task
- **A1-1**: "Change Taiwan flights and hotel" - Deadline was **2026-02-13** (yesterday)
- Status: in_progress, assigned to CHAD_YI
- Action: Complete immediately or update deadline

### 2. Stats Consistency Error
- `stats.totalTasks` = 79
- Sum of workflow arrays: 6 + 6 + 1 + 5 + 54 = **72**
- **Discrepancy: 7 tasks missing from workflow arrays**
- Tasks exist in tasks{} but not in any workflow array

### 3. Ghost Task in Active Workflow
- **A6-3** appears in workflow.active[] but does NOT exist in tasks{}
- Remove from workflow.active or create the task

### 4. Status/Workflow Mismatch
- **A1-1**: status is "in_progress" but in workflow.pending[]
- Should be in workflow.active[] if truly in progress

### 5. Agent Status Discrepancy
- **Escritor**: data.json shows "active" with currentTask A2-13
- But current-task.md says "NOT SPAWNED - awaiting initial task assignment"
- These are inconsistent - agent appears spawned in dashboard but local file says otherwise

### 6. Missing Helios current-task.md
- File does not exist at /agents/helios/current-task.md

### Data Freshness
- lastUpdated: 2026-02-14T01:17:00+08:00 (9.7 hours ago)
- Status: Acceptable

### Quanta Logs Check
- No new trading signals since Feb 13 13:50
