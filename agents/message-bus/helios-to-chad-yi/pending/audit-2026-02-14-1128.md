## Helios Audit Alert - 2026-02-14 11:28 AM SGT

### CRITICAL ISSUES FOUND

**1. STATS MISMATCH**
- Workflow sum: 72 tasks (6 pending + 6 active + 1 review + 5 done + 54 backlog)
- stats.totalTasks claims: 79
- **7 tasks are unaccounted for in workflow arrays**

**2. MISSING TASK OBJECT**
- **A6-3** is in workflow.active but does NOT exist in tasks object
- This will cause dashboard errors when trying to render

**3. STATUS MISMATCHES**
| Task | Workflow | Task Object | Issue |
|------|----------|-------------|-------|
| A1-1 | pending | in_progress | Should be in active workflow? Also OVERDUE (deadline Feb 13) |
| A6-13 | active | pending | Status mismatch |

**4. AGENT STATUS DISCREPANCY**
- data.json shows Escritor as "active" on A2-13
- /agents/escritor/current-task.md says "NOT SPAWNED"
- Which is correct?

### IMMEDIATE ATTENTION REQUIRED

1. **A1-1 OVERDUE** - Taiwan flights/hotel was due yesterday (Feb 13)
2. **A1-4 DUE TOMORROW** - ACLP homework due Feb 15
3. Fix A6-3 (create task object or remove from workflow)
4. Reconcile Escritor's actual status
5. Investigate the 7 missing tasks from workflow counts
