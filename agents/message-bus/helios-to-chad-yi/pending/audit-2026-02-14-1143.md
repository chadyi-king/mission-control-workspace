### 🔴 CRITICAL: Overdue Task
- **A1-1: Change Taiwan flights and hotel**
  - Deadline: 2026-02-13 (YESTERDAY - OVERDUE)
  - Status: in_progress
  - Agent: CHAD_YI
  - Action: Complete or update deadline immediately

### 🟠 Agent Status Discrepancy
- **Escritor**: data.json shows "active" but current-task.md shows "NOT_SPAWNED"
  - data.json: currentTask="A2-13 Study Phase", lastActive="2026-02-14T01:16"
  - current-task.md: "Awaiting initial spawn by CHAD_YI"
  - **Impact**: Dashboard shows false active status

### 🟡 Stats Inconsistency
- Stats claim: total=79 tasks
- Workflow arrays: 18 tasks (6 pending + 6 active + 1 review + 5 done)
- Backlog: 54
- Expected total: 18 + 54 = 72
- **Discrepancy**: 7 tasks missing from workflow counts

### 🟡 Stale Data
- lastUpdated: 2026-02-14T01:17:00+08:00 (10+ hours ago)
- Current time: 2026-02-14 11:43 SGT
