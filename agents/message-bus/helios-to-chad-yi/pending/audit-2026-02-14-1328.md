# Helios Audit Report - 2026-02-14 13:28 SGT

## Summary
4 issues found requiring attention.

## Critical Issues

### 1. A1-1 Status Mismatch + Overdue
- **Task:** A1-1 - Change Taiwan flights and hotel
- **Problem:** Task status is "in_progress" but sits in `workflow.pending` array
- **Action:** Move to `workflow.active` array
- **URGENT:** Deadline was Feb 13 (yesterday) - 20 hours overdue

### 2. A1-2 Missing from Workflow Array
- **Task:** A1-2 - Daily payments
- **Problem:** Status is "active" but not in `workflow.active` array
- **Action:** Add "A1-2" to `workflow.active`

### 3. Stats/Workflow Inconsistency
- **Problem:** Sum of workflow states (72) ≠ totalTasks (79)
- **Missing:** 7 tasks not accounted for in workflow arrays
- **Note:** This is likely related to issues #1 and #2 above

### 4. Escritor current-task.md Incorrect
- **File:** `/agents/escritor/current-task.md`
- **Current (Wrong):** "Chapter 1 First Draft" 
- **Should Be:** "A2-13 Study Phase - Reading chapters 1-12 + answering questions"
- **Note:** Chapter 1 (A2-1) was completed Feb 5, 2026

## Data Quality
- lastUpdated: 2026-02-14T01:17:00+08:00 (12h stale - acceptable)
- No new trading signals from Quanta (blocked, no OANDA credentials)
- Escritor lastActive matches data.json (2026-02-14T01:16:00+08:00)

## Recommended Actions
1. Fix A1-1: Move from workflow.pending to workflow.active, update status to "active"
2. Fix A1-2: Add to workflow.active array
3. Update Escritor current-task.md to reflect actual Study Phase work
4. Verify A1-1 has been completed (overdue task)
