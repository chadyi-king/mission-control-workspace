## Helios Audit - Feb 14, 20:13 SGT

Issues Found: 2

### 1. OVERDUE TASK
**A1-1: Change Taiwan flights and hotel**
- Deadline was **February 13** (yesterday)
- Today is February 14
- Status shows "in_progress" but past deadline
- **Action required:** Update deadline or mark complete

### 2. Stats Math Error
- Workflow sum: 7+6+1+5+54 = **73 tasks**
- Stats claim: **80 total**
- **7 tasks are unaccounted for** in workflow counts
- Likely: Some tasks have status that doesn't map to workflow arrays
