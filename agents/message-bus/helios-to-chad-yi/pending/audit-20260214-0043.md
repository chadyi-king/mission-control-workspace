## Helios Audit - 00:43 SGT (Feb 14, 2026)

Issues Found: 4

### 1. STATS DISCREPANCY (Data Integrity)
- Expected total: 6 pending + 6 active + 1 review + 5 done + 54 backlog = **72**
- data.json claims: **79 totalTasks**
- **Missing: 7 tasks** from workflow arrays
- Recommendation: Audit all tasks to find which 7 are not categorized

### 2. OVERDUE CRITICAL TASK
- **A1-1**: Change Taiwan flights and hotel
- Deadline was: **Feb 13, 2026** (YESTERDAY)
- Status still shows "pending" not "overdue"
- Hours remaining shows 20 (incorrect - should be negative)

### 3. AGENT FILE STALE (Escritor)
- Escritor's `current-task.md` last updated: **Feb 12**
- Shows task: A2-12 (Chapter Outline)
- data.json shows: **A2-13** (Study Phase) is active
- Agent activity stale by 2 days

### 4. MISSING AGENT TRACKING FILES
- `/agents/chad-yi/current-task.md` - does not exist
- `/agents/helios/current-task.md` - does not exist
- Only Quanta, MensaMusa, Escritor have current-task.md files

### Trading Signals (Quanta)
- No new signals since Feb 13 16:22 UTC
- Last log activity: Feb 13 13:50 (watcher stopped)
- Bot appears idle, not capturing live signals

---

## ✅ What's Working

- Last updated timestamp is recent (00:06 SGT, 37 min ago)
- Workflow arrays populated correctly for tracked tasks
- Agent statuses consistent in data.json
- Urgent tasks properly flagged (A1-1, A1-4, B6-6, B6-3)

---

## Action Needed: YES

### Immediate Actions:
1. **Fix A1-1 status** - Mark as overdue or completed
2. **Update Escritor's current-task.md** to reflect A2-13 Study Phase
3. **Create current-task.md** for chad-yi and helios
4. **Reconcile 7 missing tasks** - find why they're not in workflow arrays

### Lower Priority:
5. Check if Quanta signal watcher is still running (no logs since Feb 13)
