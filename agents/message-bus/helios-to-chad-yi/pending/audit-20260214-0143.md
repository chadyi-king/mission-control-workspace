## Helios Audit Alert — Feb 14, 01:43 SGT

### Issues Requiring Attention

**1. Stats Mismatch in data.json**
- Workflow total: 72 tasks (6+6+1+5+54)
- stats.totalTasks: 79
- **7 tasks are unaccounted for** — not in any workflow array
- Likely tasks with status "blocked" or other edge cases not being counted

**2. Overdue Task: A1-1**
- **Task**: Change Taiwan flights and hotel
- **Deadline**: Feb 13, 2026 (yesterday)
- **Current Status**: `in_progress`
- **Action**: Either complete and mark done, or update deadline if extension needed

### Other Findings

| Check | Status |
|-------|--------|
| Agent CURRENT_TASK.md files | ❌ None exist (expected) |
| Quanta new signals | ⚠️ None in 13+ hours (last: Feb 13 12:05 PM) |
| LastUpdated timestamp | ✅ 26 min ago (acceptable) |

### Recommendations
1. Fix stats calculation to include blocked tasks
2. Update A1-1 status or deadline
3. Check if Quanta signal reader is still running
