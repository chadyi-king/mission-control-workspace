Issues Found: 5

### 🔴 CRITICAL: Overdue Task
- **A1-1**: "Change Taiwan flights and hotel" 
  - **Deadline was**: 2026-02-13 (YESTERDAY)
  - **Status**: Still showing as "pending" in workflow
  - **Action**: Update status or complete immediately

### ⚠️ Data Consistency Issue
- **Stats mismatch**: 
  - Workflow sum: 6+6+1+5+54 = 72 tasks
  - totalTasks claims: 79 tasks
  - **Missing**: 7 tasks not counted in workflow arrays

### ⚠️ Agent Status Discrepancies
All agent `current-task.md` files show "NOT SPAWNED" but data.json shows:
- **Escritor**: Listed as "active" on A2-13, but file says "NOT SPAWNED"
- **Quanta/MensaMusa/Autour**: Files say "NOT SPAWNED" (matches data.json "blocked/not_spawned")

**Recommendation**: Sync agent task files with data.json state.
