Issues Found: 5

### 1. CRITICAL: Overdue Task
- **A1-1**: "Change Taiwan flights and hotel" was due **2026-02-13** (OVERDUE by ~18 hours)
- Agent: CHAD_YI
- Status: In progress but past deadline

### 2. Data Consistency Issue
- Stats show: 79 total tasks
- Workflow arrays total: 18 (6+6+1+5)
- Backlog: 54
- Expected: 72 tasks, but stats claim 79
- **7 tasks are unaccounted for** in workflow arrays

### 4. Missing Data Structure
- Missing `inputsNeeded` in workflow - shows 2 but details exist
- Some tasks may not be properly categorized in workflow arrays

### 5. Upcoming Deadline
- **A1-4**: "Send ACLP homework" due 2026-02-15 (tomorrow night)

Action Needed: Yes

### Recommendations
1. **URGENT**: Address A1-1 Taiwan flights (overdue)
2. Verify and fix the 7 missing tasks in workflow arrays
3. Sync agent current-task.md files with data.json states
4. Complete A1-4 ACLP homework before tomorrow night
