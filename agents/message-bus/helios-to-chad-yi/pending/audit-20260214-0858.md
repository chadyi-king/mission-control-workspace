**Data File:** `/home/chad-yi/.openclaw/workspace/mission-control-dashboard/data.json`  
**Last Updated:** 2026-02-14T01:17:00+08:00 (7.7 hours ago)

### Issues Found: 4

#### 1. OVERDUE TASK (Critical)
- **A1-1: Change Taiwan flights and hotel**
- Deadline: 2026-02-13 (YESTERDAY)
- Status: in_progress
- Agent: CHAD_YI
- **Action Required:** Task is 1 day overdue. Needs immediate attention or deadline update.

#### 2. STATS INCONSISTENCY
- **Stats Claim:** totalTasks = 79
- **Workflow Sum:** pending(6) + active(6) + review(1) + done(5) + backlog(54) = **72**
- **Discrepancy:** 7 tasks unaccounted for in workflow arrays
- **Root Cause:** Tasks with status "blocked" (A5-1, A5-2) and others not properly categorized in workflow arrays

#### 3. AGENT STATUS DISCREPANCY - Escritor
- **data.json shows:** Escritor status "active", currentTask "A2-13"
- **current-task.md shows:** "NOT SPAWNED - awaiting initial task assignment"
- **Issue:** Task A2-13 exists but Escritor agent has never been spawned
- **Note:** A2-13 marked as "active" in workflow but no actual agent session running

#### 4. UPCOMING DEADLINES (Next 72 Hours)
- **A1-4: Send ACLP homework** - Due 2026-02-15 (tomorrow)
- **A1-5: Rebook ACLP reassessment** - Due 2026-02-19
- **B6-3: SPH items to order** - Due 2026-02-17 (3 days)
- **B6-6: Find facilitators for ESU** - Due 2026-02-17 (3 days)
- **B6-7: Check insurance for SMU event** - Due 2026-02-17 (3 days)

### Quanta Trading Logs
- **Recent Activity:** YES - New signals in all_messages.jsonl
- **Last Signal:** 2026-02-13 (yesterday) - Multiple XAUUSD buy/sell signals
- **Status:** Bot is receiving signals but cannot execute (no OANDA credentials)

---

### Action Needed: YES

**Immediate Actions:**
1. Address overdue A1-1 (Taiwan flights) - update status or extend deadline
2. Decide on Escritor: Either spawn agent for A2-13 OR move task back to pending
3. Review A1-4 (ACLP homework) due tomorrow

**Data Integrity:**
- Stats vs workflow mismatch needs fixing (7 tasks missing from workflow arrays)
- Consider adding "blocked" status to workflow or categorizing blocked tasks under backlog

- Dashboard structures: All present (agents, projects, workflow, inputsNeeded, etc.)
- Data integrity: Minor issues (stats discrepancy, agent status mismatch)
