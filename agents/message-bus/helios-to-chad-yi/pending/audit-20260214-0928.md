# Helios Audit Report - 2026-02-14 09:28 SGT

## OVERDUE TASK - IMMEDIATE ATTENTION

**A1-1: Change Taiwan flights and hotel**
- Deadline: 2026-02-13 (YESTERDAY)
- Status: in_progress
- Agent: CHAD_YI
- **This task is now overdue by 1 day**

---

## Data Integrity Issues

### 1. Stats Mismatch
```
Calculated from workflow: 6 + 6 + 1 + 5 + 54 = 72
data.json claims: 79
Missing: 7 tasks
```

### 2. Missing Task Object
**A6-3** appears in `workflow.active` but task object doesn't exist in `tasks`.
- Workflow shows: A1-2, A2-13, A6-3, A6-13, A6-14, B6-3
- Only 5 of these have task objects (A6-3 missing)

### 3. Status/Workflow Inconsistency
- A1-1 has status "in_progress" but is in `workflow.pending` array
- Should likely be in `workflow.active`

---

## Agent State Mismatches

### Escritor
| Source | Status | Task |
|--------|--------|------|
| current-task.md | NOT SPAWNED | Waiting for A2-12 |
| data.json | active | A2-13 Study Phase |

**Issue**: File is outdated. A2-12 is marked done in tasks, A2-13 is active.

### Quanta / MensaMusa
- Both show `NOT SPAWNED - blocked` in current-task.md
- data.json shows status "blocked" correctly
- No signals.md file exists for Quanta (may be expected pre-spawn)

---

## Urgent Deadlines (Next 7 Days)

| Task | Deadline | Hours Left |
|------|----------|------------|
| A1-1 | 2026-02-13 | **OVERDUE** |
| A1-4 | 2026-02-15 | ~38 hours |
| B6-3 | 2026-02-17 | ~86 hours |
| B6-6 | 2026-02-17 | ~86 hours |
| B6-7 | 2026-02-17 | ~86 hours |

---

## Recommended Actions

1. **URGENT**: Address A1-1 Taiwan trip - now overdue
2. Fix stats consistency (investigate 7 missing tasks)
3. Either create A6-3 task object or remove from workflow.active
4. Update Escritor's current-task.md to reflect A2-13 work
5. Verify A1-1 status should be "active" not "in_progress"
