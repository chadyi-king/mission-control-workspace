## CRITICAL: Overdue Task

**A1-1: Change Taiwan flights and hotel**

⚠️ This task is now overdue. Needs immediate attention.

## Data Integrity Issues

### Stats Mismatch
- Workflow sum: 72 tasks
- Stats claim: 79 tasks  
- **7 tasks missing from workflow arrays**

Tasks not in any workflow array (need to verify status):
- A2-4, A3-1, A3-2, A3-3, A4-1, A4-2, A4-3, A5-1, A5-2, A6-14, A6-15, A6-16, A6-17, A6-18, B1-1... (and more)

Many tasks exist in `tasks` object but aren't categorized in workflow.pending/active/review/done arrays.

### Agent File Out of Sync
**Escritor:**
- data.json: active, working on A2-13
- current-task.md: NOT_SPAWNED, waiting for A2-12

File needs updating to reflect actual status.

---

## Recommendations

1. **URGENT:** Update A1-1 status - either complete or move deadline
2. Fix stats: Recalculate backlog count (should be 61, not 54)
3. Update Escritor's current-task.md to match A2-13
4. Consider running workflow cleanup to ensure all tasks are categorized
