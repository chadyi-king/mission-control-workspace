# Helios Audit Alert - Feb 14, 12:28 PM

## Summary
4 issues requiring CHAD_YI attention.

---

## 🔴 CRITICAL: Overdue Task

**A1-1: Change Taiwan flights and hotel**
- **Deadline: Feb 13, 2026 (YESTERDAY)**
- Status: Still pending in data.json
- Assigned: CHAD_YI

**Action:** Mark complete if done, or update deadline if still in progress.

---

## ⚠️ Data Integrity Issue

**Stats Mismatch:**
- `stats.totalTasks` reports: 79
- Calculated total: 72 (6+6+1+5+54)
- **Missing: 7 tasks**

**Likely cause:** Some tasks have `backlog` status but aren't counted in stats.backlog.

**Action:** Run data consistency check to find orphaned tasks.

---

## ⚠️ Agent Status Sync Issues

Three agents have mismatched status between `current-task.md` and `data.json`:

| Agent | File Status | Dashboard Status |
|-------|-------------|------------------|
| Escritor | NOT_SPAWNED | active |
| Quanta | NOT_SPAWNED | blocked |
| MensaMusa | NOT_SPAWNED | blocked |

**Action:** Update current-task.md files to reflect actual agent states.

## ⏰ Upcoming Deadline

**A1-4: Send ACLP homework** - Due **tomorrow night (Feb 15)**
