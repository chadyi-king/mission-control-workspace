## Helios Audit - 2026-02-14 14:13 SGT

Issues Found: 3

### 1. STATS INCONSISTENCY ⚠️
- **Expected**: pending(6) + active(6) + review(1) + done(5) + backlog(54) = **72**
- **Actual totalTasks**: **79**
- **Difference**: 7 tasks unaccounted for in workflow
- Likely cause: Blocked tasks (A5-1, A5-2) and other pending tasks not in workflow arrays

### 2. STATUS MISMATCH ⚠️
- **Task A6-14**: Status is "pending" in tasks object but appears in `workflow.active` array
- Should be status: "active" to match workflow placement

### 3. AGENT FILE STALE ⚠️
- **Escritor current-task.md** shows outdated info:
  - File says: "Chapter 1 First Draft"
  - data.json says: "A2-13 Study Phase - Understand Story"
  - Last file update: stale content

### Urgent Deadlines Check
- A1-1 (Taiwan flights): **OVERDUE** - deadline was Feb 13
- A1-4 (ACLP homework): Due tomorrow night (Feb 15)
- B6-3, B6-6, B6-7: Due Feb 17 (3 days remaining)

### Quanta Logs
- No new signals since last audit
- Database locked error (expected - Quanta blocked)

### Data Freshness
- lastUpdated: 2026-02-14T01:17:00+08:00 (13 hours ago)
- Status: Acceptable for 15-min audit cycle

Action Needed: **Yes**

**Recommended fixes:**
1. Update A6-14 status to "active" in data.json
2. Update stats.totalTasks to 72 OR include blocked tasks in backlog count
3. Refresh Escritor's current-task.md to match A2-13 Study Phase
4. Address OVERDUE task A1-1 (Taiwan flights)
