- Missing workflow array for "blocked" status (2 tasks: A5-1, A5-2)

### 3. ⚠️ URGENT DEADLINES (< 48h)

## Action Needed: YES

**Immediate actions required:**
1. Address overdue A1-1 (Taiwan flights)
2. Fix stats.pending to reflect 66 pending tasks
3. Add blocked workflow array for A5-1, A5-2
4. Sync workflow.pending with actual pending tasks

**Recommended:**
- Add `blocked` array to workflow section
- Update stats to: pending=66, blocked=2, backlog=7 (or remove backlog stat)
- Clarify distinction between "pending" and "backlog"
