## Helios Audit - 18:13 SGT

**Issues Found: 3**

### 1. Stats Inconsistency
- Workflow tasks: 7 pending + 6 active + 1 review + 5 done = 19
- Stats claim: 80 total, 54 backlog
- **Problem:** 19 + 54 = 73, not 80. **7 tasks unaccounted for.**

### 2. OVERDUE Task
- **A1-1:** "Change Taiwan flights and hotel"
- Deadline was **2026-02-13** (yesterday)
- Status still shows "in_progress"
- ⚠️ **Task is overdue by 1 day**

### 3. Agent Task Mismatch
- **Escritor:** current-task.md says "Chapter 1 First Draft"
- **data.json:** A2-13 is "Study Phase - Understand Story"
- These don't match — which task is actually active?

### 4. Missing Helios File
- `/agents/helios/current-task.md` does not exist

### 5. Quanta Logs
- No new trading signals since Feb 13 (only test signal)
- BTCUSD analysis logged today at 07:54/08:03
