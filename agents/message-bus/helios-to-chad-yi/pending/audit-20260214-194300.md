- Sum: **73** | Reported total: **80**
- Missing 7 tasks from workflow categorization

### 2. OVERDUE TASK 🚨
- **A1-1**: "Change Taiwan flights and hotel"
- Deadline: **Feb 13** (yesterday) - NOW OVERDUE
- Status: "in_progress" but deadline passed
- Current display shows "20 hours remaining" which is wrong

### 3. AGENT TASK MISMATCH
- **Escritor**: current-task.md shows "A2-13: Chapter 1 First Draft"
- data.json shows "A2-13: Study Phase - Reading chapters 1-12 + answering 90 questions"
- Descriptions don't align - needs reconciliation

### 4. DATA STRUCTURE ISSUES
- `urgentDeadlines` array has 3 items but `urgentTaskDetails` has 4
- `stats.urgent` = 3 but actual urgent tasks = 4 (B6-8 missing from urgentDeadlines)

### QUANTA LOGS
- Last signal: Feb 14 08:03 UTC (BTCUSD Analysis)

### Recommended Actions

3. Add missing 7 tasks to workflow arrays
4. Sync urgent task arrays (add B6-8 to urgentDeadlines)
