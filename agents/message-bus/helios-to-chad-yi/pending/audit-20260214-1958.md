## Helios Audit Alert - Feb 14, 19:58

### Data Integrity Issues Found

**1. Stats Mismatch**
- `stats.totalTasks`: 80 (incorrect)
- Actual tasks in object: 73
- **Fix needed:** Update totalTasks to 73

**2. Workflow/Status Mismatch**
- A1-1: In "pending" workflow but status is "in_progress"
- A6-3: In "active" workflow but task doesn't exist
- **Fix needed:** Sync workflow arrays with task statuses

### CRITICAL: Overdue Task

| Task | Deadline | Status | Owner |
|------|----------|--------|-------|
| **A1-1: Change Taiwan flights and hotel** | **Feb 13** (yesterday) | in_progress | CHAD_YI |

This task is **1 day overdue**. Requires immediate attention.

### Quick Fixes
```bash
# Update stats.totalTasks from 80 to 73
# Move A1-1 from pending workflow (or update status to pending)
# Remove A6-3 from active workflow (task doesn't exist)
```
