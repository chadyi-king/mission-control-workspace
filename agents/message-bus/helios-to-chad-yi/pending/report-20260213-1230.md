## Helios Report - 2026-02-13 12:30 SGT

### Agent Status
| Agent | Status | Progress | Blocker |
|-------|--------|----------|---------|
| CHAD_YI | Active | A6-3 Dashboard audit | None |
| Helios | Active | 15-min audit cycle | None |
| Escritor | Active | A2-13 Study Phase (90 questions) | None |
| Quanta | Ready | OANDA configured, awaiting signals | None (was: OANDA creds) |
| MensaMusa | Blocked | Needs Moomoo setup | Moomoo account credentials |
| Autour | Idle | No tasks assigned | Waiting for CHAD_YI |

### Discrepancies
- **Quanta:** Dashboard shows "blocked" but reality is READY. OANDA credentials are configured (confirmed 2026-02-13). Status should be updated to "active".
- **MensaMusa:** Dashboard shows "blocked - Moomoo credentials" which matches reality, but current-task.md references Quanta's setup file instead of its own.
