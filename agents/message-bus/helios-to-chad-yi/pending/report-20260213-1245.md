### Discrepancies
- **Quanta status mismatch:** Dashboard shows "blocked" with "OANDA credentials needed" but current-task.md confirms ✅ OANDA credentials ARE configured and ready for live trading
- **MensaMusa blocker unclear:** Dashboard shows "Moomoo credentials needed" but current-task.md references TRADING_SETUP.md - need clarification on actual blocker
- **Quanta signal capture working:** Successfully captured XAUUSD BUY signal at 12:05 today (test passed)
