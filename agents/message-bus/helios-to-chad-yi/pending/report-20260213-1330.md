### Discrepancies
- **Dashboard shows Quanta as "blocked"** but reality is **READY FOR LIVE TRADING**
  - current-task.md shows: "✅ OANDA credentials configured" and "Ready for live trading"
  - Dashboard agents.quanta.status still shows "blocked" with "OANDA credentials needed"
  - **ACTION REQUIRED**: Update dashboard to reflect Quanta's new ready status
- Quanta lastActive shows 2026-02-08 but current-task.md was recently updated
