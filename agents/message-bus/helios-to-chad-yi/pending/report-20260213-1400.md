## Helios Report - 2026-02-13 14:00 SGT

### Agent Status
| Agent | Status | Progress | Blocker |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| CHAD_YI | Active | Working on A6-3 dashboard infrastructure audit per data.json | None reported |
| Escritor | Active | Continuing A2-13 study phase (answering 90 questions) | None reported |
| Quanta | Ready | OANDA credentials configured, awaiting live signals from CallistoFX | Waiting for next signal (no credentials blocker) |
| MensaMusa | Blocked | No trading setup progress since last audit | Needs Moomoo account credentials |
| Autour | Not spawned | No assignments in current-task.md | Waiting for CHAD_YI to delegate work |

### Discrepancies
- Dashboard (lastUpdated 12:45 SGT) still lists Quanta as "blocked" and needing OANDA credentials, but `agents/quanta/current-task.md` shows credentials configured and agent standing by for live signals.
- `urgentTaskDetails.B6-3` labels the task as "Elluminate pitch deck" while `tasks.B6-3` is "SPH items to order" due 17 Feb.

### Critical Alerts
- A1-1 "Change Taiwan flights and hotel" deadline is today (2026-02-13) and remains in progress.
- No new signals found in `agents/quanta/logs/`; `signals/PENDING` directory currently empty.
