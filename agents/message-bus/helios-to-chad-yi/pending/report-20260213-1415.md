### Discrepancies Found
- **Quanta**: Dashboard shows "blocked" but agent reports OANDA credentials configured and ready for live trading. Status should be "ready" not "blocked".
- **MensaMusa**: Dashboard shows "blocked - needs Moomoo credentials" but current-task.md indicates general "trading setup required". May need clarification on specific blocker.
- **Quanta's live monitor crashed** at 13:50 with SQLite database lock error - requires restart.
