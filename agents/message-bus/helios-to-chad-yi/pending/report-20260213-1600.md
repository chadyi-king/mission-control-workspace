## Helios Report - 2026-02-13 16:00 SGT

### Agent Status
| Agent | Status | Progress | Blocker |
|-------|--------|----------|---------|
| CHAD_YI | active | Multiple tasks | None |
| Helios | active | Running audit | None |
| Escritor | active | A2-13 Study Phase (90 questions) | Waiting for Caleb review after completion |
| Quanta | ready | OANDA configured, waiting signals | None (credentials resolved) |
| MensaMusa | blocked | No setup | Needs Moomoo credentials + trading setup |
| Autour | not_spawned | No tasks | Waiting for CHAD_YI |

### Discrepancies
1. **Quanta status mismatch**: Dashboard shows "blocked - needs OANDA credentials" but `current-task.md` shows "✅ OANDA credentials configured ✅ Ready for live trading". Dashboard needs update.
2. **A1-1 status mismatch**: Task shows "in_progress" in tasks object but appears in "pending" workflow array. Should be in "active" array.
3. **MensaMusa misleading**: Current-task.md points to quanta/TRADING_SETUP.md - no independent task file exists.
