## Helios Report - 2026-02-13 16:00 SGT (Cycle 2)

### Agent Status
| Agent | Status | Progress | Blocker |
|-------|--------|----------|---------|
| CHAD_YI | active | Handling multiple active/urgent tasks | None |
| Helios | active | Running 15-minute audits | None |
| Escritor | active | A2-13 Study Phase (90 questions) | Awaiting completion + Caleb review |
| Quanta | ready | Monitoring CallistoFX; signal parser live | None (credentials resolved) |
| MensaMusa | blocked | No automation started | Needs Moomoo credentials + workflow setup |
| Autour | not_spawned | Idle | Waiting for task assignment |

### Discrepancies
1. **Quanta status mismatch** – Dashboard still shows "blocked: needs OANDA credentials" but agent file reports credentials configured and system ready.
2. **A1-1 workflow mismatch** – Task `A1-1` marked `in_progress` in task object yet listed under `workflow.pending` instead of `workflow.active`.
3. **MensaMusa guidance** – `current-task.md` only redirects to `../quanta/TRADING_SETUP.md`; dashboard lists blocker as missing credentials, but there is no active setup plan tracked.

### Critical Alerts
- **Deadline TODAY** – `A1-1: Change Taiwan flights and hotel` still open with deadline 2026-02-13. Resolve within ~8 hours.
- **Trading Signal (12:05 SGT)** – XAUUSD BUY signal remains in `/agents/quanta/signals/PENDING/` awaiting action:
  - Entry 2680-2685 | SL 2675 | TPs 2700 / 2720 / 2740 / 2760 / 2780
- **Upcoming (Feb 17)** – `B6-3 SPH items to order` and `B6-6 Find 120 facilitators for ESU` due in 4 days.

*Log review:* `signal_alerts.log` and `telegram_live.log` show no entries after the 12:05 SGT XAUUSD capture; no new signals detected this cycle.
