## Helios Report - 2026-02-13 16:30 SGT

### Agent Status
| Agent | Status | Progress | Blocker |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| CHAD_YI | Active | Working A1-1 flights/hotel change and A6 dashboard fixes; no update logged since A1-1 was moved to in_progress | A1-1 deadline today @23:59, awaiting confirmation of changes |
| Helios | Active | Running 15-minute audit cycle | None |
| Escritor | Active | Still in A2-13 study phase; answers file not yet created in outbox | None (expected reading/answering) |
| Quanta | Should be active | monitor_callistofx.py exited at 13:50 with sqlite3 database lock; current-task says ready & waiting for signals | Needs Telethon session unlock/restart to resume live monitoring |
| MensaMusa | Blocked | Awaiting trading setup per TRADING_SETUP.md | Requires Moomoo credentials |
| Autour | Not spawned | Idle | Awaiting assignment |

### Discrepancies
- Dashboard still lists Quanta as “Blocked – needs OANDA credentials,” but `current-task.md` shows credentials configured; actual issue is Telethon session lock causing the monitor to crash.
- `urgentTaskDetails.A1-1.hoursRemaining` = 20, but real time remaining is ~7.5 hours (deadline tonight).
- `agentDetails.escritor.idleHours` not reflected in dashboard (AGENT_STATE shows 16.5h idle); consider updating last-active metadata.
- `urgentDeadlines` entry for B6-3 labels “Elluminate pitch deck,” while the task description/logs track “SPH items to order” due 17 Feb.

### Critical Alerts
- A1-1 (Change Taiwan flights/hotel) due today and still in progress—no confirmation of completion logged.
- Quanta trading monitor crashed (sqlite3 database locked) at 13:50, so no live signal capture is running until restarted.
