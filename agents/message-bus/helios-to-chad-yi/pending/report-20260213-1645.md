### Discrepancies
- **Quanta**: Dashboard shows "BLOCKED: Needs OANDA API credentials (120h idle)" but reality is "✅ OANDA credentials configured, ready for live trading" - **NEEDS DASHBOARD UPDATE**
- **Quanta**: Signal alert system tested successfully at 12:05 today (XAUUSD BUY captured)
- **MensaMusa**: Dashboard shows "Moomoo credentials needed" but reality references Quanta's TRADING_SETUP.md - may need clarification

### Critical Alerts
- 🚨 **A1-1 DUE TODAY (Feb 13)**: "Change Taiwan flights and hotel" - status is "in_progress" but deadline is TODAY
- ⚠️ **B6-3 DUE Feb 17**: "SPH items to order" - 4 days remaining
- ⚠️ **B6-6 DUE Feb 17**: "Find facilitators for ESU" - need 120 facilitators confirmed
- ⚠️ **B6-7 DUE Feb 17**: "Check insurance for SMU event" - newly added today
- ✅ **Quanta signal system**: Tested and working - captured XAUUSD BUY signal at 12:05 SGT
- ⚠️ **Quanta monitor error**: Database locked error in quanta_live_1350.log - may need restart

### Trading Signals
