## Helios Report - 2026-02-13T17:30+08:00

### Agent Status
| Agent | Status | Progress | Blocker |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| CHAD_YI | Active | A6 dashboard tasks ongoing; A1-1 still open | None noted, but A1-1 deadline today |
| Helios | Active | Running 15-minute audit cycle | None |
| Escritor | Active | Working through A2-13 study questions | None |
| Quanta | Ready | OANDA credentials configured; awaiting live signal ingestion | Telegram listener crashed at 13:50 (sqlite DB locked) |
| MensaMusa | Blocked | No movement on A5-2 options workflow | Needs Moomoo account credentials |
| Autour | Not spawned | No current assignment | Awaiting delegation |

### Discrepancies
- Dashboard lists Quanta as "Blocked: Needs OANDA credentials" but current-task.md confirms credentials are in place and the agent is ready; actual issue is a Telegram session DB lock that stopped monitoring at 13:50.

### Critical Alerts
- A1-1: Change Taiwan flights and hotel — deadline today (≈6.5 hours remaining) and still incomplete.
- Quanta signal listener stopped at 13:50 due to sqlite database lock; live signals will be missed until the monitor is restarted.
