## Helios Report - 2026-02-13T18:00:00+08:00

### Agent Status
| Agent | Status | Progress | Blocker |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Escritor | Active | Working through A2-13 study assignment; no answers file in outbox yet | None reported |
| Quanta | Ready / Waiting Signals | OANDA credentials marked configured; standing by for CallistoFX feed | Dashboard still flags missing OANDA credentials |
| MensaMusa | Blocked | Awaiting trading setup guidance (see ../quanta/TRADING_SETUP.md) | Needs Moomoo account credentials |
| Autour | Idle | No tasks started; current-task file awaiting delegation | Dashboard lists agent as "not_spawned" |

### Discrepancies
- Dashboard marks Quanta as blocked for OANDA credentials, but current-task shows credentials configured and agent waiting on live signals.
- Dashboard lists Autour as "not_spawned", yet agent directory and current-task.md indicate the bot is online and waiting for assignment.
- mission-control-dashboard/data.json lastUpdated at 2026-02-13T14:48:00+08:00 (over 3 hours ago); confirm latest edits captured if further changes were made since then.
