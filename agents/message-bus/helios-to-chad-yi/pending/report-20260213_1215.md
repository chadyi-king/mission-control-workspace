## Helios Report - 2026-02-13 12:15 SGT

### Agent Status
| Agent | Status | Progress | Blocker |
|-------|--------|----------|---------|
| CHAD_YI | Active | A6-3: Dashboard audit infrastructure | None |
| Helios | Active | Running 15-minute audit | None |
| Escritor | Active | A2-13: Study Phase (90 questions) | None |
| Quanta | **READY** | OANDA configured, awaiting signals | ~~OANDA~~ (RESOLVED) |
| MensaMusa | Blocked | A5-2: Options flow | Moomoo credentials (120h idle) |
| Autour | Not Spawned | No tasks assigned | Waiting for CHAD_YI |

### Discrepancies
- **Dashboard shows Quanta as "blocked"** but reality is **READY** - OANDA credentials now configured, signal watcher running
- **Quanta status needs update** from "blocked" → "active" in data.json
- **MensaMusa idle time** shows 120h but last check was Feb 8 - may need verification

### Critical Alerts
- **A1-1 due TODAY** - "Change Taiwan flights and hotel" deadline Feb 13, still pending
- **Quanta captured XAUUSD signal** at 12:05:26 - BUY 2680-2685, SL 2675, TPs 2700-2780
- **B6-6 due in 4 days** (Feb 17) - Find 120 facilitators for ESU
- **B6-3 due in 4 days** (Feb 17) - SPH items to order

### Signal Details
```
Pair: XAUUSD
Direction: BUY
Entry: 2680.0-2685.0
SL: 2675.0
TPs: 2700, 2720, 2740, 2760, 2780

```

### Recommendations
1. **URGENT**: Complete A1-1 today (Taiwan flights/hotel)
2. Update Quanta status in dashboard to "active"
3. Verify MensaMusa blocker status - still needs Moomoo?
4. Delegate task to Autour or keep on standby
