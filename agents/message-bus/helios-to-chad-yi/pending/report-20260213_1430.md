## Helios Report - 2026-02-13 14:30 SGT

### Agent Status
| Agent | Status | Progress | Blocker |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Escritor | Active | Working through 90-question RE:UNITE study pack; no answers submitted yet | None |
| Quanta | Ready | OANDA credentials configured; standing by for live CallistoFX signals | Dashboard still marks agent as blocked |
| MensaMusa | Blocked | Awaiting guidance from CHAD_YI on trading setup | Needs Moomoo credentials / trading setup confirmation |
| Autour | Idle | No assignments | Awaiting task delegation |

### Discrepancies
- Dashboard shows Quanta as “Blocked – needs OANDA credentials,” but agent confirms credentials are configured and is only waiting for new signals.
- Quanta monitor log at 13:50 shows Telethon `sqlite3.OperationalError: database is locked`; monitoring may have stopped and needs a restart.

### Critical Alerts
- A1-1 “Change Taiwan flights and hotel” deadline is today (2026-02-13) and remains in progress.
- No fresh trading signals captured; standing by.
