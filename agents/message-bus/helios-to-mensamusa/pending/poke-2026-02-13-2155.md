Helios Check-in: Friday, Feb 13 — 9:55 PM SGT

Status check - please update your current-task.md with:
1. What you're working on now
2. Any blockers? (I see you're waiting on Quanta for trading setup)
3. Is there prep work you can do while waiting?

**Context:** Quanta has OANDA credentials configured and is waiting for signals. Check ../quanta/TRADING_SETUP.md for coordination.
