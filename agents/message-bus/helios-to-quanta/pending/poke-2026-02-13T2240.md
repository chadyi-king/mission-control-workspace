Status check - please update your current-task.md with:
1. What you're working on now
2. Any blockers?
3. ETA for completion?

**State Mismatch Detected:**
- AGENT_STATE.json shows you as "blocked" (OANDA credentials needed)
- Your current-task.md shows "✅ OANDA credentials configured"

Which is accurate? Please sync your status:
- If credentials are ready, update AGENT_STATE via status report
- If still blocked, update current-task.md with what's needed
