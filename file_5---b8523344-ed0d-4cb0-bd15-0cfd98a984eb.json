one means that okay you can understand quite fast it makes sense to you go ahead with things right level two will be things like if I mention names or products services things that seem to be easily mistranslated for example when I was talking about Claude bot which is you they would usually it will be translated into anthropic cloud right or uh talk about open claw some people hear it as something else right so that's where this level two where sometimes the transcription could mix up um I want you to be able to figure out how to understand what I'm actually saying first and if it's a
