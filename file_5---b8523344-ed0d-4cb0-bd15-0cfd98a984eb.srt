1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:08,880
I would say let's do this in three levels okay so for example one if this transcription is great

2
00:00:08,880 --> 00:00:13,920
which is what I'm seeing right in front of me you are you are saying that uh even though there's a

3
00:00:13,920 --> 00:00:18,000
huge fan in the background there's a lot blowing and everything you can still understand me and

4
00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:24,240
you are transcribing it correctly and the items and everything makes sense to you

5
00:00:24,240 --> 00:00:30,960
that's level one means that okay you can understand quite fast it makes sense to you go ahead with

6
00:00:30,960 --> 00:00:42,880
things right level two will be things like if I mention names or products services things that

7
00:00:42,880 --> 00:00:52,080
seem to be easily mistranslated for example when I was talking about Claude bot which is you they

8
00:00:52,080 --> 00:01:01,280
would usually it will be translated into anthropic cloud right or uh talk about open claw some people

9
00:01:01,280 --> 00:01:07,040
hear it as something else right so that's where this level two where sometimes the transcription

10
00:01:07,040 --> 00:01:15,680
could mix up um I want you to be able to figure out how to understand what I'm actually saying

11
00:01:15,680 --> 00:01:23,200
first and if it's a mistake then you can ask for clarification right now level three is where

12
00:01:23,200 --> 00:01:27,680
I guess it's just really it doesn't make sense to you about what I'm asking for

13
00:01:28,880 --> 00:01:33,920
and then yeah just let me know how I can help you to fix that
