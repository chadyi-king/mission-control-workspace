0	8880	I would say let's do this in three levels okay so for example one if this transcription is great
8880	13920	which is what I'm seeing right in front of me you are you are saying that uh even though there's a
13920	18000	huge fan in the background there's a lot blowing and everything you can still understand me and
18000	24240	you are transcribing it correctly and the items and everything makes sense to you
24240	30960	that's level one means that okay you can understand quite fast it makes sense to you go ahead with
30960	42880	things right level two will be things like if I mention names or products services things that
42880	52080	seem to be easily mistranslated for example when I was talking about Claude bot which is you they
52080	61280	would usually it will be translated into anthropic cloud right or uh talk about open claw some people
61280	67040	hear it as something else right so that's where this level two where sometimes the transcription
67040	75680	could mix up um I want you to be able to figure out how to understand what I'm actually saying
75680	83200	first and if it's a mistake then you can ask for clarification right now level three is where
83200	87680	I guess it's just really it doesn't make sense to you about what I'm asking for
88880	93920	and then yeah just let me know how I can help you to fix that
