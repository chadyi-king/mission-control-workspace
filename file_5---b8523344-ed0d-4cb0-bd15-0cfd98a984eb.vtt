I would say let's do this in three levels okay so for example one if this transcription is great

00:08.880 --> 00:13.920
which is what I'm seeing right in front of me you are you are saying that uh even though there's a

00:13.920 --> 00:18.000
huge fan in the background there's a lot blowing and everything you can still understand me and

00:18.000 --> 00:24.240
you are transcribing it correctly and the items and everything makes sense to you

00:24.240 --> 00:30.960
that's level one means that okay you can understand quite fast it makes sense to you go ahead with

00:30.960 --> 00:42.880
things right level two will be things like if I mention names or products services things that

00:42.880 --> 00:52.080
seem to be easily mistranslated for example when I was talking about Claude bot which is you they

00:52.080 --> 01:01.280
would usually it will be translated into anthropic cloud right or uh talk about open claw some people

01:01.280 --> 01:07.040
hear it as something else right so that's where this level two where sometimes the transcription

01:07.040 --> 01:15.680
could mix up um I want you to be able to figure out how to understand what I'm actually saying

01:15.680 --> 01:23.200
first and if it's a mistake then you can ask for clarification right now level three is where

01:23.200 --> 01:27.680
I guess it's just really it doesn't make sense to you about what I'm asking for

01:28.880 --> 01:33.920
and then yeah just let me know how I can help you to fix that
