Okay, it seems that if I'm doing a 1 minute 30 seconds voice message,

2
00:00:10,320 --> 00:00:18,160
this takes quite long to transcribe. Can you help me understand? You say that I didn't need

3
00:00:18,160 --> 00:00:23,280
to prompt you, but I did prompt you, so I don't know how long. For example, if it's a 10 second

4
00:00:23,280 --> 00:00:28,560
one, it seems like you're fine with it, but if it's a longer one, then it seems that I need to,

5
00:00:28,560 --> 00:00:36,640
you know, kind of wait for how long usually will it take. Do I have to use the cron job C-R-O-N

6
00:00:37,520 --> 00:00:40,400
to modify all of this?
