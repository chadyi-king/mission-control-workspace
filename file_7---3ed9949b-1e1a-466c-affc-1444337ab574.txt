Yeah, but you see this is where the confusion comes in.
If now the connection says it's idle, that means it's waiting for me to pump you back.
I need to understand your pro-activeness so that I can understand how to utilize you properly.
Is it due to heartbeat or whatever?

So can you please help me walk me through as to how do I use you the best in order to achieve the goals that I want to have?
Yeah, you can type it as lengthy as possible.
