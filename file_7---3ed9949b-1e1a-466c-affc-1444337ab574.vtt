If now the connection says it's idle, that means it's waiting for me to pump you back.

00:16.800 --> 00:25.960
I need to understand your pro-activeness so that I can understand how to utilize you properly.

00:25.960 --> 00:27.960
Is it due to heartbeat or whatever?

00:27.960 --> 00:32.960
So these are a lot of new terms I've never used before, I don't understand how to use you.

00:32.960 --> 00:39.960
So can you please help me walk me through as to how do I use you the best in order to achieve the goals that I want to have?

00:39.960 --> 00:43.960
Yeah, you can type it as lengthy as possible.
