0	6360	Okay, so before even if I go into the daily routine problems and whatever, all these kinds
6360	13680	of things, what I want specifically is to make sure that whatever I'm saying, you can
13680	17640	understand and reply to me and automate that, right?
17640	25000	But the problem is that what I'm seeing right now is that you say that you automatically
25000	27800	transcribe and prompt me back.
27800	36400	But so far, for the past few messages, you have transcribed it very fast, after I prompt
36400	37920	you.
37920	40760	So the problem is that I need to prompt you.
40760	45720	Is there a way that I could fix something like, once again, is that a cron job, is that
45720	52760	a heartbeat, is it something that I need to install, a skill I need to install that can
52800	58920	just double check with you or prompt you back after I send a voice message to transcribe
58920	59440	or something?
