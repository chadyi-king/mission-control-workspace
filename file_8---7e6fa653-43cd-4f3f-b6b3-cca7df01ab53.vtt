00:00.000 --> 00:06.360
Okay, so before even if I go into the daily routine problems and whatever, all these kinds

00:06.360 --> 00:13.680
of things, what I want specifically is to make sure that whatever I'm saying, you can

00:13.680 --> 00:17.640
understand and reply to me and automate that, right?

00:17.640 --> 00:25.000
But the problem is that what I'm seeing right now is that you say that you automatically

00:25.000 --> 00:27.800
transcribe and prompt me back.

00:27.800 --> 00:36.400
But so far, for the past few messages, you have transcribed it very fast, after I prompt

00:36.400 --> 00:37.920
you.

00:37.920 --> 00:40.760
So the problem is that I need to prompt you.

00:40.760 --> 00:45.720
Is there a way that I could fix something like, once again, is that a cron job, is that

00:45.720 --> 00:52.760
a heartbeat, is it something that I need to install, a skill I need to install that can

00:52.800 --> 00:58.920
just double check with you or prompt you back after I send a voice message to transcribe

00:58.920 --> 00:59.440
or something?
