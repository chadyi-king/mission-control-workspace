1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:08,760
Okay, so once again, you are saying that you don't, I don't need to manually do anything.

2
00:00:08,760 --> 00:00:14,080
But every time I have to, after I send a voice message, I have to say, okay, reply, because

3
00:00:14,080 --> 00:00:17,480
you're saying that you're transcribing the latest voice message.

4
00:00:17,480 --> 00:00:21,440
But the moment I say, okay, reply, you actually transcribe it very, very quickly.

5
00:00:21,440 --> 00:00:26,360
Yeah, which is after you transcribe it, then you already prompt me back, right?

6
00:00:26,360 --> 00:00:29,240
So with this, this is the conversation I'm having.

7
00:00:29,240 --> 00:00:36,240
So right now I'm seeing that the current issue is that I send a message, you say you're transcribing,

8
00:00:36,240 --> 00:00:39,800
but you don't automatically reply me.

9
00:00:39,800 --> 00:00:45,940
So I have to prompt you almost immediately and actually you do it quite fast.

10
00:00:45,940 --> 00:00:47,800
So then that's where my issue is.

11
00:00:47,800 --> 00:00:53,760
Can you create a way that after I send you the voice message, then you tell me or you're

12
00:00:53,760 --> 00:01:00,080
transcribing blah, blah, blah, but then you prompt yourself again to reply me?

13
00:01:00,080 --> 00:01:01,840
Because that's not happening and that's the issue.
