0	8760	Okay, so once again, you are saying that you don't, I don't need to manually do anything.
8760	14080	But every time I have to, after I send a voice message, I have to say, okay, reply, because
14080	17480	you're saying that you're transcribing the latest voice message.
17480	21440	But the moment I say, okay, reply, you actually transcribe it very, very quickly.
21440	26360	Yeah, which is after you transcribe it, then you already prompt me back, right?
26360	29240	So with this, this is the conversation I'm having.
29240	36240	So right now I'm seeing that the current issue is that I send a message, you say you're transcribing,
36240	39800	but you don't automatically reply me.
39800	45940	So I have to prompt you almost immediately and actually you do it quite fast.
45940	47800	So then that's where my issue is.
47800	53760	Can you create a way that after I send you the voice message, then you tell me or you're
53760	60080	transcribing blah, blah, blah, but then you prompt yourself again to reply me?
60080	61840	Because that's not happening and that's the issue.
