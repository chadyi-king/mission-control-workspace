Okay, so once again, you are saying that you don't, I don't need to manually do anything.

00:08.760 --> 00:14.080
But every time I have to, after I send a voice message, I have to say, okay, reply, because

00:14.080 --> 00:17.480
you're saying that you're transcribing the latest voice message.

00:17.480 --> 00:21.440
But the moment I say, okay, reply, you actually transcribe it very, very quickly.

00:21.440 --> 00:26.360
Yeah, which is after you transcribe it, then you already prompt me back, right?

00:26.360 --> 00:29.240
So with this, this is the conversation I'm having.

00:29.240 --> 00:36.240
So right now I'm seeing that the current issue is that I send a message, you say you're transcribing,

00:36.240 --> 00:39.800
but you don't automatically reply me.

00:39.800 --> 00:45.940
So I have to prompt you almost immediately and actually you do it quite fast.

00:45.940 --> 00:47.800
So then that's where my issue is.

00:47.800 --> 00:53.760
Can you create a way that after I send you the voice message, then you tell me or you're

00:53.760 --> 01:00.080
transcribing blah, blah, blah, but then you prompt yourself again to reply me?

01:00.080 --> 01:01.840
Because that's not happening and that's the issue.
