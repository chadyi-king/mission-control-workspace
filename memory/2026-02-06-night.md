# MISSION DASHBOARD - NIGHT SHIFT LOG

## Time: 2026-02-06 02:30
**User Status:** Asleep (back to sleep after feedback)
**Next Check:** Cron will ping me every 30 minutes

## ISSUES USER REPORTED (TO FIX):

### 1. ✅ FIXED: A6 Missing from Categories
- Added A6 Mission Control to Ambition category
- Shows "46% complete (12/26 tasks)"
- Count updated from 5 to 6 projects

### 2. ✅ FIXED: Sidebar Blocking Content
- Content now shifts when sidebar expands
- JavaScript toggles 'sidebar-expanded' class on main-container and stats-bar
- Smooth 0.3s transition

### 3. 🔄 PENDING: Project Click Shows Tasks
- Need to make ALL project cards clickable
- Should open project modal with tasks list
- Currently only A6 has onclick handler

### 4. ⏳ PENDING: 30-Second Auto-Refresh
- Code exists: setInterval(loadData, 30000)
- Need to verify it actually works
- User wants to see real-time updates
