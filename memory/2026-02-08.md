## Mission Control Dashboard - Major Progress

### Completed Today:

1. **Dashboard Verification Fixed (Tasks 1-13)**
   - Patched data.json to include flattened `tasks` array (67 tasks total)
   - Fixed unsupported CSS selectors (`.panel:has(...)`) replaced with stable IDs
   - Added `ensureTasksStructure()` function to rebuild tasks from workflow
   - Added guards for activity feed to prevent crashes
   - Automated tests now pass: add/edit/complete/delete tasks all functional
   - Stats bar, workflow pipeline, filters, search all working

2. **Data Normalization**
   - All A/B/C category projects now show uniform stats:
     - 12 total tasks, 3 active, 6 completed, 25% progress
   - Merged via PR to main branch

3. **Visual Enhancements**
   - Enhanced Solar Core avatar with textured sun design:
     - Multi-layer radial gradient (yellow core → orange → red → dark crimson)
     - Surface texture with sunspot patches
     - Pulsing glow animation
   - Committed to sidebar-redesign branch

4. **Chrome Extension Setup**
   - Successfully set up OpenClaw Chrome Extension relay
   - Port 18792 active and reachable
