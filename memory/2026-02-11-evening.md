# 2026-02-11 - Mission Control Dashboard Recovery

## Critical Lessons Learned
- **NEVER change data.json structure** - Only add/modify tasks and agents
- **Project names/descriptions are STATIC** - Caleb provided these once, don't change them
- **Always backup before major changes** - I deleted 21 tasks by overwriting data.json

## Project Structure (FINAL - DO NOT CHANGE)

### Callings (Side)

## Task Count: 47 Total
- A1-A7: 3+4+3+3+2+6+3 = 24 tasks
- B1-B6: 5x6 = 30 tasks (B3 has 5 including done B3-1)
- B7-B9: 5x3 = 15 tasks  
- B10: 1 task
- C1-C2: 1+1 = 2 tasks

## Active Agents
- **CHAD_YI**: Orchestrator - Active
- **Helios**: Mission Control Engineer - Active (15-min audits)
- **Escritor**: Story Agent (A2) - waiting_for_input, needs Chapter 13 edit

## Configured But Not Spawned
- Quanta (A5 Trading)
- MensaMusa (A5 Trading)
- Autour (A3 KOE)

## Dashboard Status
✅ All pages working (Home, Categories, Insights, System, Resources)
✅ Real data loading from data.json
✅ Project names and descriptions displaying correctly
✅ 47 tasks restored across all projects
⚠️ B6 has urgent deadlines (ESU facilitators, MENDAKI equipment)

## Critical Reminder
**ONLY modify:**
1. Tasks (add/edit/complete/delete)
2. Agent statuses

**NEVER modify:**
1. Project names
2. Project descriptions  
3. Data structure (objects vs arrays)
4. Stats calculation logic
