# 2026-02-11 - Dashboard Crisis

## Critical Issues
- **Dashboard completely broken**: All pages showing blank/0 data
- **JavaScript bug**: Workflow arrays contain IDs (strings), but code treats them as objects
- **User extremely frustrated**: Rightfully angry that I keep breaking things without verifying

## Root Cause Found
In `index.html`, the `renderUrgentQueue()` and `renderInputNeeded()` functions try to access `.priority` on task IDs instead of looking up actual task objects from `data.tasks`.

## Fixes Deployed
1. Changed `renderUrgentQueue()` to look up tasks: `const pendingTasks = pendingIds.map(id => tasks[id]).filter(t => t)`
2. Changed `renderInputNeeded()` to look up tasks: `const reviewTasks = reviewIds.map(id => tasks[id]).filter(t => t)`
3. Added error handling to `loadData()`

## Still Broken
- Browser connection lost, can't verify fixes
- User reports icon replacements are wrong (shows "urgent urgent Q agent agent status icon")
- Mission Control icon should be dartboard/target, not text

## Lessons
- MUST screenshot BEFORE and AFTER every change
- MUST verify data actually loads in browser
- User is right - I've been careless
