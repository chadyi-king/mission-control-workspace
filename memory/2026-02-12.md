# 2026-02-12 - Session Log

## Dashboard Fixes (WF-001, WF-002)
**Status:** ✅ FIXED
- Fixed stats mismatch: active 8→0, review 2→0, backlog 53→63
- Verified: 78 total tasks (13 pending, 0 active, 0 review, 2 done)
- Dashboard structure preserved, only data corrected

## Quanta Trading Agent Setup
**Status:** ⚠️ CONFIGURED, AWAITING AUTH

**Telegram Config Created:**
- API ID: 32485688
- API Hash: f9ee9ff7b3b7c37bb3b213709eb3ad99
- Phone: +6591593838
- Monitor script: `/agents/quanta/monitor_callistofx.py`

**Issue:** First auth attempt blocked by Telegram security (code was entered by me, not user). Telegram flagged it as "code shared with others."

**Next Step:** Caleb needs to run `python3 monitor_callistofx.py` at home and enter SMS code himself.

## OANDA API Discussion
**Status:** ⏳ WAITING FOR CREDENTIALS
- Asked if Caleb wants to provide OANDA API
- He has not provided yet
- Task A5-3 still pending

## Tasks Updated
- **A5-4:** Quanta Telegram → Configured, needs auth
- **A5-3:** OANDA setup → Waiting for credentials
- **A6-20:** Telegram CLI docs → ✅ Created

## New Document Received
- PDF file received from Caleb
- Image-based/scanned PDF, cannot extract text
- Waiting for Caleb to describe what it is

## Categories Page Mobile Modal - MAJOR REDESIGN
**Status:** ✅ COMPLETE (v6)

**Problem:** Mobile modal showed too much chrome (stats, filters, progress bars) - only 1 task visible, hard to read.

**Solution:** Complete redesign to be task-focused:
- Removed: progress bar, quick stats, meta info, filter controls
- Minimized header (just project name + close button)
- Task list takes 85%+ of modal space
- Compact task rows show 6-8 tasks at once
- Removed duplicate "View full task list" button (was same as "Open Project")

**Cache busting:** CSS now at v6, requires browser cache clear to see changes.

## Agent Model Assignment (Complete)
**Status:** ✅ ALL 12 AGENTS COVERED

| Model | Agents |

| qwen2.5:7b | Helios, Quanta, MensaMusa, Clair, Kotler, Ledger, Abed |
