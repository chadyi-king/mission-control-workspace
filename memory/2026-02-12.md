## Data Integrity Crisis

### The Problem
- Commit 767f587 ("CRITICAL: Fix data integrity issues") accidentally reduced 70+ tasks to 8 tasks
- Caleb reports missing detailed A1/A5 task descriptions that he remembers discussing
- Cannot find these tasks in any git commit or file history

### What Was Recovered
- Restored 70 tasks from git commit 53856e1 (pre-disaster)
- Current state: 70 tasks total, but only 1 A1 and 2 A5 tasks

### What Remains Missing
- Detailed A1 task descriptions (Caleb says there were "so many")
- Detailed A5 task descriptions beyond the 2 found
- These may have been in Telegram conversations but never committed to data.json

## Quanta Trading Bot Updates

### v3.1 Implemented
- Position sizing: Entry at middle of range (Caleb's method)
- Exit strategy: 10%/10%/20%/30%/30% closes at each TP
- SL management: Move to BE at TP1, +20 pips at +50, trail at -50 pips after +100
- Code committed but not yet running (user needs to start it)

### Memory Created
- `/agents/quanta/MEMORY.md` - Full trading strategy parameters

---

## Agent Memory System Created

Each agent now has persistent MEMORY.md:
- `/agents/quanta/MEMORY.md` - Trading rules
- `/agents/escritor/MEMORY.md` - Story guidelines
- `/agents/mensamusa/MEMORY.md` - Options monitoring
- `/agents/helios/MEMORY.md` - Audit checklist

## User Frustration

Caleb is frustrated that:
1. Design changes caused data loss
2. No backups were automatically created before changes
3. Cannot find the detailed tasks he remembers discussing

He has given permission to search Telegram history but tools don't support this.

## Next Steps Required

1. **User must provide missing A1/A5 tasks** - Cannot be found in any accessible files
2. **Start Quanta** - Run `python3 monitor_callistofx.py`
3. **Consider better backup strategy** - Daily auto-backups before any changes
