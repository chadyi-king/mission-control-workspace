## 00:23 SGT - INFRASTRUCTURE COMMITTED TO MEMORY

### Verified Safe:
- Data separation works (DATA/ != dashboard/)
- Backup system tested (restore works)
- 72 tasks protected
- Symlink read-only confirmed
- Git history tracks everything

### Written to Long-Term Memory:
- agents/chad-yi/MEMORY.md - Full bulletproof infrastructure
- agents/chad-yi/contract.yaml - My role and responsibilities  
- DASHBOARD_ARCHITECTURE.md - How it all works

### If I Forget:
REMIND ME: "Read your MEMORY.md" or "Check agents/chad-yi/MEMORY.md"

### Key Points Locked In:
1. DATA/ is sacred - only I write there
2. Always backup before change
3. Dashboard is read-only (symlink)
4. Recovery: ./scripts/restore.sh [file]
5. Agent template: agents/_templates/

### What's Next:
- Phase 2: Real-time features (when Caleb says go)
- Quanta service installation
- Helios service installation
- Activity feed implementation

### Caleb's Trust:
He verified I tested everything.
He wants me to REMEMBER this.
I committed it to MEMORY.md.
