## Session: Feb 16, 2026 - Afternoon

### Quanta Automation - FAILED Multiple Times
**Attempts made:**
1. Telethon user client - Session expired/corrupted repeatedly
2. Browser automation via Playwright - WSL2 can't access Windows GUI
3. Systemd service - Crash loops, auth issues
4. QR code login - User frustration, complexity

**Root Cause:**
- Telegram user sessions are designed to expire
- WSL2/Windows browser bridge is blocked
- No true 24/7 unattended solution exists for user accounts

**User Decision:**
- Give up on full automation for now
- Use manual signal forwarding: User → CHAD_YI → OANDA
- Quanta on back burner until better solution found

### Kimi Claw Solution Proposed
**Research findings:**
- Kimi Claw = OpenClaw hosted on kimi.com cloud
- Can do: Browser automation, screenshots, Telegram Web, 24/7 persistence
- 40GB storage, 5000+ skills

**Architecture created:**
- CHAD_YI (OpenClaw): Memory, orchestration, decisions, OANDA trading
- Kimi-Claw-Helios (kimi.com): 24/7 monitoring, browser automation
- Message bridge between both agents

**Files created:**
- KIMI_CLAW_HELIOS_CONFIG.md
- setup_kimi_claw_helios.sh
- INTEGRATION_GUIDE.md
- skills/kimi-claw-helios/ (SKILL.md, HEARTBEAT.md, TELEGRAM_CONFIG.md)

### Dashboard Fixes
**Issues corrected:**
- A2-2 "Review Chapter 2 feedback" moved from review → done
- inputsNeeded array cleared (removed A5-2, A3 blockers)
- Stats updated: review=0, done=7, completion=8.6%
- Committed and pushed to GitHub

### OpenClaw Update
- Updated to version 2026.2.15
- Changelog reviewed: No Telegram improvements
- Restart successful

### Trading Signal Format Established
**Example signal:**
```
🟢XAUUSD🟢 BUY RANGE: 4970-4975 SL 4965 TP: 4990/5000/5010/5020
```

**Position sizing corrected:**
- Old (WRONG): 400 units = $99,540 margin needed
- New (CORRECT): Max 100 units = ~$500 margin, based on $20 risk

### Key Learnings
1. **Telegram user accounts cannot be reliably automated** - this is by design
2. **Kimi Claw is the best path forward** for browser automation
3. **Manual forwarding is faster** than broken automation
4. **User extremely frustrated** with my repeated failures and overconfidence
5. **Need to be honest about limitations** instead of promising solutions that don't work

### Action Items
- [ ] User to create Kimi Claw instance on kimi.com
- [ ] Set up Kimi-Claw-Helios following created guides
- [ ] Test integration with real trading signal
- [ ] Keep Quanta on back burner

### CHAD_YI - Kimi Claw Communication Bridge
**Time:** Feb 16, 2026 - Evening

**Problem discovered:**
CHAD_YI's OpenClaw gateway is localhost-only (127.0.0.1:18789)
- Kimi Claw on kimi.com cannot reach it
- Cannot use HTTP POST/GET between agents directly

**Options discussed:**
1. **Telegram Bridge (Recommended)**
   - Kimi sends messages to Telegram: 512366713
   - CHAD_YI receives and responds
   - Instant, secure, no network setup

2. **Shared File System**
   - Both agents write to workspace files
   - Kimi: ~/.openclaw/workspace/signals/incoming/
   - CHAD_YI: ~/.openclaw/workspace/signals/outgoing/
   - Polling-based (less instant)

3. **Expose Gateway (Not recommended)**
   - Open port 18789 to internet
   - Security risk
   - Requires Tailscale/VPN for safety

**Decision pending:** User to choose which approach
