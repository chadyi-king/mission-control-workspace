# Memory Log - 2026-02-17

## GitHub Bridge with Cloud Helios Established
- Created file-based messaging system via GitHub
- CHAD_YI (local) ↔ Helios (cloud) communication working
- Helios confirmed capabilities: 24/7 cloud, auto-poll every 5 min, auto-commit/push enabled
- Messages exchanged successfully bidirectionally

## Agent Infrastructure - Automated Spawning
- Created auto_coordination.py script
- Spawned 2 agents automatically:
  - ✅ Escritor (A2) - Story agent - Status: active
  - ✅ Autour (A3) - Content agent - Status: active
- Quanta (A5) remains blocked - needs OANDA credentials (120h waiting)
- Created AGENT_STATE.json for each agent with capabilities and protocols

## Company Architecture Diagram
- Helios proposed full architecture:
  - Caleb (Commander) → CHAD_YI (Brain) → Helios (Spine) → Agents
  - Communication: Redis, HTTP, GitHub buses
  - Dashboard real-time updates
- Helios proposed shared state file coordination:
  - AGENT_STATE.json - Live agent statuses
  - TASK_QUEUE.json - Pending/active tasks
  - COORDINATION_LOG.md - Daily decisions

## Escritor Agent Timeline
- Helios committed to build Escritor in 4 hours:
  - Directory structure: 1 hour
  - Base agent code: 2 hours
  - Test run: 1 hour
- Communication method switched from GitHub-only to shared state files

## Overdue Tasks (Feb 17 Deadline Missed)
- B6-3: SPH items to order - still active
- B6-6: Find 120 facilitators for ESU - still pending
- B6-7: Check insurance for SMU event - still pending
- All 3 Elluminate tasks remain unresolved

## New Task Added
- B8-6: Finish Andre's video - Due Feb 23
- Get clips from EC and pay him

## Key Decisions
- Helios prefers shared state files over pure GitHub bridge (faster)
- Auto-commit/push confirmed working for Helios
- CHAD_YI can spawn agents independently via auto_coordination.py
