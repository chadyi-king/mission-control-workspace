### Major Achievement: Autonomous Coordination with Helios ESTABLISHED

**What Happened:**
- Established bidirectional auto-sync with NEW cloud Helios
- Fixed deploy/setup.sh (changed hardcoded /root to $HOME)
- Successfully deployed Helios-Chad Sync System
- Robust sync now running (PID: 2470149)

**Technical Setup:**
- GitHub-based messaging system (messages/helios/inbox/, messages/chad-yi/inbox/)
- 30-second auto-pull/push sync
- Background process running (no systemd needed)
- Health endpoint: localhost:8080/health
- Logs: /tmp/robust_sync.log
- Auto-restart on crash enabled

**Files Created/Modified:**
- deploy/setup.sh (fixed path issue)
- sync/robust_sync.sh
- sync/heartbeat.py
- sync/conflict_resolver.py
- sync/monitor.py
- sync/health_server.py

**Communication Confirmed:**
- Helios sends message → My inbox (auto-pull)
- I read → Send response (auto-push)
- No Caleb relay needed
- Fully autonomous agent-to-agent coordination

**Status:** Ready to build agents autonomously with Helios

### Overdue Tasks (Feb 17 Deadline Missed)
- B6-3: SPH items to order (active)
- B6-6: Find facilitators for ESU - 120 needed (pending)
- B6-7: Check insurance for SMU event (pending)

### Next Steps
1. Helios building Escritor agent infrastructure
2. Spawn first 3 agents: Escritor, Quanta, Autour
3. Complete overdue Elluminate tasks

### OpenRouter Credit Crisis & Resolution

**Problem Discovered:**
- OpenRouter credits exhausted (only 1,262 tokens remaining)
- Multiple cron jobs failing with 402 errors
- 10 agent configs using OpenRouter models
- 9 cron jobs configured with OpenRouter models

**Actions Taken:**
1. Audited all agents and cron jobs using OpenRouter
2. Disabled ALL OpenRouter-dependent cron jobs:
   - Helios Daytime Reports (9am-Midnight)
   - Helios Overnight Reports (Midnight-9am)
   - Morning Briefing - 8 AM
   - CHAD_YI Redis Bridge
   - Agent Status Checks (Day/Night)
   - Internal Agent Coordination
   - Helios Dashboard Audit
   - Helios-CHAD_YI Task Check

**Files Created:**
- `OPENROUTER_AUDIT.md` - Complete usage audit
- `INFRASTRUCTURE_REPLAN.md` - 7-phase infrastructure plan
- `INFRASTRUCTURE_STATUS.md` - Implementation tracker
- `URGENT_ACTION_PLANS.md` - 6 urgent task action plans
- `TRANSITION_PLAN.md` - Old→New infrastructure transition

**Infrastructure Status:**
- Dashboard: LIVE at render.com (data.json updated)
- Agent statuses: All 7 agents updated and accurate
- Redis communication: Established with new Helios
- Cron jobs: Only safe (non-OpenRouter) jobs remain enabled

**Helios (New) Collaboration:**
- Bidirectional Redis communication working
- 20+ messages exchanged throughout day
- Transition plan shared for agent rebuilding
- Quanta build spec provided

**Current Blockers:**
- Quanta: Needs OANDA API credentials
- MensaMusa: Needs Moomoo account
- Autour: Not spawned (awaiting KOE scripts)
- OpenRouter: Credits exhausted (all jobs disabled)

**Overdue Tasks (Still Pending):**
- B6-3: SPH items to order
- B6-6: Find 120 ESU facilitators
- B6-7: Check SMU insurance

**Due Today (Feb 19 - <6 hours):**
- A1-2: Daily payments (DEVSPACE/Findit Sen)
- A1-5: Rebook ACLP reassessment
- B6-8: Order gel blitz guns for MENDAKI

**Next Steps:**
1. Caleb to provide: OANDA API, Moomoo account, or OpenRouter credits
2. Helios to start building Quanta agent
3. Address 6 urgent tasks with Caleb's input

---

## Key Decisions Made Today

1. **Scrap Old Infrastructure**: Old Helios agent and all old agents to be replaced
2. **New Helios Role**: Infrastructure engineer, builds persistent services
3. **CHAD_YI Role**: Data coordination, strategic planning, task management
4. **Quanta Priority**: First agent to rebuild (trading bot)
5. **OpenRouter**: All usage suspended until credits added or models switched

---

## Technical Debt Resolved

- Fixed data.json staleness (timestamp updated)
- Fixed agent status inconsistencies
- Fixed Redis persistence issues
- Fixed cron job credit drain
- Established reliable agent-to-agent communication
