So for example one, if this transcription is great, which is what I'm seeing right in front of me, you are saying that even though there's a huge fan in the background, there's a lot blowing and everything, you can still understand me and you are transcribing it correctly and the items and everything makes sense to you. That's level one. You can understand quite fast, it makes sense to you, go ahead with things. Level two will be things like if I mention names or products, services, things that seem to be easily mistranslated. For example, when I was talking about Claude Baud, which is you, usually it would be translated into Anthropic Cloud, or talk about OpenClaw, some people hear it as something else. So that's level two where sometimes the transcription could mix up. I want you to be able to figure out how to understand what I'm actually saying first and if it's a mistake, then you can ask for clarification. Level three is where I guess it just really doesn't make sense to you about what I'm asking for. Just let me know how I can help you to fix that.",

For example, if it's a 10 second one, it seems like you're fine with it, but if it's a longer one, then it seems that I need to wait for how long it usually will take.

But so far, for the past few messages, you have transcribed it very fast after I prompt you. So the problem is that I need to prompt you. Is there a way that I could fix something like, once again, is that a cron job? Is that a heartbeat? Is it something that I need to install, a skill I need to install that can just double check with you or prompt you back after I send a voice message to transcribe or something?",

So right now I'm seeing that the current issue is that I send a message, you say you're transcribing, but you don't automatically reply me. So I have to prompt you almost immediately and actually you do it quite fast. So then that's where my issue is. Can you create a way that after I send you the voice message, then you tell me or you're transcribing blah, blah, blah.
