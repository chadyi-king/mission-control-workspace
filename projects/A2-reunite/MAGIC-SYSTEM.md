# RE:UNITE — Magic System Reference
**File Purpose:** How magic works for writing agent

---

## MAGIC BASICS

**Core Principle:**
- Magic is will/intent-based — "Just will. Control. Command."
- No wands, no chanting, no rituals
- It's an interaction/listening with elements, not brute force
- Like using your body — gets tired if overused (muscle exhaustion analogy)

**Activation:**
- All newborns get Ether bath — opens "Mana Pores"
- Everyone can use ALL 5 elements (Avatar-style)
- Skill depends on understanding/science of the element

## THE 5 ELEMENTS

### 1. EARTH (Most Common)
- **Usage:** Soil, stone, minerals, terrain manipulation
- **Skill Level:** Everyone can move basic earth; only skilled can manipulate different stone types
- **District:** Farmland (specialists)
- **Exhaustion:** Low — earth is stable and obedient

### 2. WATER (Tricky)
- **Usage:** Flow control, irrigation, ice/mist states
- **Skill Level:** Must consider flow and movement; water doesn't obey like earth
- **District:** Aquaculture (specialists)
- **Exhaustion:** Medium — must constantly guide the flow

### 3. AIR (Unpredictable)
- **Usage:** Speed, mobility, wind manipulation
- **Skill Level:** Depends on environment; if wind is too strong, can't use
- **District:** Transport (specialists)
- **Exhaustion:** Medium-High — air flows freely, hard to control

### 4. LIGHT (Fixed Path)
- **Usage:** Illusions, refraction, blinding flashes
- **Physics:** Moves in straight lines; can be bent/refracted
- **District:** Magic (specialists)
- **Skill Level:** Creating illusions requires understanding light physics
- **Exhaustion:** Low-Medium — predictable but requires precision

### 5. FIRE (Most Dangerous)
- **Usage:** Offense, heat, destruction
- **Danger Level:** **HIGHEST** — once started, it spreads and consumes
- **Skill Level:** Hardest to control; must control how fire feeds
- **District:** Blacksmith (specialists — learned heat regulation)
- **Exhaustion:** High — fire is hungry and unstable

## RYFEL'S INNOVATION

**Why He's Different:**
- Applies Earth science/physics knowledge to magic
- Understands elemental interactions at molecular level
- Creates combinations (earth+fire=explosive shrapnel, etc.)

**Combat Approach:**
- Analyzes opponents scientifically
- Creates counter-strategies
- Uses inventions + magic together

## MAGIC LIMITATIONS

**Physical Limits:**
- Gets tired like using muscles
- Overuse = exhaustion, can't cast
- Concentration required

**Elemental Limits:**
- Can't create elements from nothing (must manipulate existing)
- Fire spreads uncontrollably if not managed
- Air depends on environmental wind
- Light always moves in straight lines (physics constraint)

**Ryfel's Limits:**
- Inventions need prep time
- Gun only fires 1-2 shots before needing repair
- Can't mass-produce technology (needs blacksmiths)
