## World Geography

**CRITH** = The world (not a kingdom)

**Three Main Regions:**
1. **MINAS-COL** — Kingdom of survivors, hidden behind high walls and fog. Built by refugees who fled fallen kingdoms. Ryfel's home.
2. **RUNEVIA** — Largest, most powerful kingdom. Has a massive tower. Magic-based hierarchy (magic = rank/wealth/right to exist). Seeks to conquer all.
3. **DESPERA** — Lawless land between kingdoms. No kings, no rulers, no law. Strong rule, weak suffer. Land of assassins, smugglers, criminals, warriors, merchants.

## The Five Elements (All people can use all elements)

**Magic System Basics:**
- Everyone has mana (opened by Ether bath at birth)
- No wands, no incantations, no chanting
- Will/intent-based: "Just will. Control. Command"
- It's an interaction/listening, not brute force commanding
- Like using your body/muscles — can get tired from overuse
- Understanding the science/logic of elements = better control

**The Five Elements:**

1. **EARTH** — Most common, easiest to learn. Different soils/stones require skill to manipulate. House Redimir specializes here.

2. **WATER** — Trickier because you must consider flow. Not about force, about guiding.

3. **AIR** — Doesn't always listen. Depends on environment/wind. Flows freely.

4. **LIGHT** — Moves in straight lines. Can be used for tricks (like changing eye color).

5. **FIRE** — **Most dangerous, hottest, hardest to control.** Once it starts, it spreads. Consumes rather than moves. Blacksmith District excels here (learned to regulate heat for weapons).

**Why Ryfel is Different:**
- His Earth background (intergalactic tech, physics knowledge)
- Logical/scientific approach — understanding materials at molecular level
- Creates innovations like guns that shoot bullets (limited capacity, needs repair)

## Character Facts

**Marcus Seneca / Ryfel Redimir:**
- Former US VP (youngest at 39), Navy SEAL background
- Led "Planetarium Project" — turned Earth into intergalactic spaceship
- Assassinated by sniper during UN Global Summit speech
- Reborn as Ryfel with full memories
- Uses magic from day of birth (unheard of — called "genius" level)
- Has super strength from birth (crushed stone/clay as newborn)

**Family:**
- **Ryker** — Father, enthusiastic, dramatic, exclaims "RYYY-KERRR!", loves throwing Ryfel in the air
- **Elda** — Mother, sharp, politically aware, sighs at Ryker's antics
- **Milal** — Servant, food-loving, casual, friendly

## The Cosmic Eye

**DOES EXIST** — Chapter 2 description:
- Marcus sees it between death and rebirth
- "A vast, luminous white eye, glowing in the cosmic darkness"
- Ancient presence, pulls him toward rebirth
- Purpose unclear — possibly deliberate selection for rebirth

## What Was WRONG in Old Bible

| Wrong | Correct |
|-------|---------|
| Tai Chi for mana circulation | Magic is will/brain-based, not physical technique |
| Light = fifth elite element | Fire = most dangerous/hottest; all 5 equal, districts specialize |
| Caste system | Districts specialize by knowledge/science, not birth caste |
| Crith = kingdom | Crith = world; Minas-Col = kingdom |
| Only some people have magic | Everyone has all 5 elements, skill varies by understanding |

## Open Threads for Chapter 13

- Ryfel's gun weapon (1-2 shots per battle, needs repair)
- Need blacksmiths for blueprints to create more
- Light magic mastery (straight-line physics applications)
- Runevia threat (they want to conquer Minas-Col)
- House Redimir's new political position post-tournament
