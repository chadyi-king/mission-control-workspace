Chapter 1: A World United

The Embark Pt. 1
Reporter:
"We now turn to the highlights of the speech from the Vice President of the United States of America at the UN Global Summit. Marcus Seneca, titled the Golden Boy, is the youngest Vice President in American history at age 39, adored by many in his country for his excellence during his time with the Navy SEALs. Today, he makes his first formal address to the UN on the Global Plan for the Unification of all countries."

Vice President Marcus Seneca:
"Good evening, my fellow friends all over the world. I would like to start off by thanking you for trusting both my dear friend and leader, President Don John Treagan, and I with this responsibility to bear. A heavy burden—as though we are Atlas carrying the weight of the world on our shoulders.

"But we hope that in these six years, we have shown you our ability and sincerity through our leadership of this intergalactic vision that we are all gathered here today to witness. Today marks the beginning of the unification of all countries, as we embark on this universal journey into our first-ever intergalactic cosmic voyage. We have completed the transformation of our physical Earth into a global spaceship that can travel through the stars! The Planetarium is finally ready!

"As you have chosen us to lead through our years and achievements from the development of Terra Space Force, the President and I will bring us all into planetary wanderlust among the stars and beyond. This, I promise you."

A rounding applause fills the hall as all the nation's representatives rise to their feet in support of the Vice President as he closes his speech.

Reporter:
"There you have it, folks! A world being united by our collective desire to travel into the stars! Led by our wonderful duo, President Treagan and Vice President Seneca."

"Taking a look at how all of this came about, it was the combined vision of President Treagan and VP Seneca to unite countries together in order to embark on this journey. Nicknamed the Golden Boy among his fans, especially the female ones, due to a rating that became a viral meme where he scored a near-perfect 99.5 percent in accordance to the Golden Ratio of Beauty Phi, his golden blond hair, and his incredible story of his rise to political office..."

Politics Never Ends
Marcus entered the presidential suite, thanking the Secret Service before closing the door behind him.
'Clack… Beep.'
"Room secured."

Across the room, Sofi sat at the meeting table, watching the speech replay on the screen.

Sofi:
"A beautiful speech, but wow, what a puffed-out history of you, huh, Marcus? The youngest Vice President at age 39? Pfft, I'm younger than you, and I became House Speaker!"

She laughed, shaking her head.

Marcus:
"Good morning, Madam Speaker. Thank you for meeting me this afternoon for the briefing on the current unification events."

Sofi:
"Pfft, no one is around. You can cut the formal act."

Marcus:
"Hehe! Fineee, but I've gotten way better at it though! Look at how stoic and serious I look for the press!"

His face widened into a joyful smile, breaking the composed image he had on stage.

Sofi:
"Haha! If only they knew how much of a man-child you are behind the scenes! Half of your term in office has been spent watching cartoons and anime instead of political briefs. Leaving me to catch you up to speed on everything!"

She smirked, tucking her hair behind her ear.

Marcus:
"Awww, c'mon, Sof! Don't be like that. Today's an important day for all of us! Especially Don! It's so freaking cool that we're actually uniting the world to travel into space together! The Planetarium is ridiculously awesome!"

His eyes sparkled with excitement.

Sofi:
"Hehe, look at you, all cute like a child with a new toy. Always gets me."

Her expression softened before snapping back to focus.

Sofi:
"Anyways, I need your serious side for now. We have some major issues to discuss. As the President is focused on bringing us ahead, we were tasked with bringing the rest of the countries under our control."

Marcus:
"Understood. Please begin the briefing."

His demeanor shifted instantly—playfulness fading as he switched into work mode.

Sofi:
"East Timor and Laos are the only two nations left that have not agreed to the terms of unification. They still think they have leverage due to their rich amethyst mineral fields, which are needed for the spacecraft and stations."

Marcus:
"Let's jump straight to their demands."

Sofi:
"They are demanding a higher position among the Space Nations because of their contribution of materials and engineering know-how."

She sighed, rubbing her temples.

Sofi:
"It looks like you have to balance not only the other Great Four Superpowers but also these smaller countries if you want them all to unite."

Marcus:
"Well, you know my philosophy, Madam Speaker. I always look for a win-win scenario. World positions are mostly about the optics of their country to all other countries. What does each country want specifically?"

Sofi:
"For East Timor, their president is up for re-election soon. As the last few countries jumping onto this global bandwagon, the optics are not kind for him, especially with a majority of his supporters in favor of unification."

Marcus leaned back, tapping his fingers on the table.

Marcus:
"Alright… here's my plan."

His thoughts formalized, the gears in his mind clicking into place.

Marcus:
"His root need is simple—win re-election. To do that, he wants his standing among his nation's opposition to be unanimous. I'll meet with him and propose a visit to his country. We'll work hand-in-hand for the press, giving him a positive spin among his supporters. It will show his people that he is the only candidate who has supported our global vision. In return, once he is back in power, he will ensure that the materials are fairly traded with us for The Planetarium's further development. We can work out the details after this."

His eyes sharpened.

Marcus:
"What about Laos?"

Sofi's expression turned grim.

Sofi:
"That… is a little more tricky."

She slid a file across the table.

Sofi:
"Laos has just recently found an entirely new amethyst mineral field, making them the single largest country of raw amethyst minerals that can supply not only The Planetarium but also a full global market."

She leaned in.

Sofi:
"They want to be positioned inside the top 10 countries that have contributed to The Planetarium. If not, they won't join nor sell any of their supply to us."

Marcus furrowed his brows.

Marcus:
"A weird decision… If they don't sell to us, are they trying to create a black market for these minerals?"

His expression darkened.

Marcus:
"We don't fully know their intentions yet… but this time, a needed reminder of 'freedom' may be due. Let's discuss the details."

The Embark Pt. 2
The next day, Marcus strode through the halls of the White House, greeting the Secret Service as he made his way toward the Oval Office.

"Good morning, Mr. Vice President," one of the agents nodded.

Marcus returned the gesture before stepping inside.

Behind the Resolute Desk, President Don John Treagan sat playing with his purple ring, spinning it between his fingers. His face was unreadable—deep in thought.

The moment the door shut, Don pressed a button beneath the desk.

A soft click echoed through the room.

Outside, all agents and personnel swiftly vacated. The doors locked.

Marcus smirked. He already knew what was coming.

He walked up to the desk and extended his fist.

Don's serious expression cracked into a grin as he met the gesture.

Fist bump.

Don threw his head back in laughter…

A Vision Realized
Don Treagan:
"Wahahaha! The day has finally come, Marcus! The day we finally unite the world under our banner! One hell of a fucking day this is! We finally fucking did it!"

He leaned back in his chair, spinning it with excitement.

Marcus grinned, slamming his hands on the desk.

Marcus:
"Hell yes!"

His eyes burned with energy.

Marcus:
"I can't believe it, Don. Years of military politics and sowing our vision—we are actually going to bring about world peace. They said it was an impossible promise, but we fucking did it."

Don's grin widened as he leaned forward, resting his elbows on the desk.

Don Treagan:
"It isn't just about peace, Marcus.
"We are reshaping our entire planet into a vehicle that can travel through space! We are the literal founders of the Space Age!"

His eyes gleamed with an almost childlike excitement.

Don Treagan:
"I dreamt of this since I was freaking nine years old, making only a million dollars!"

Marcus chuckled, shaking his head.

Marcus:
"When I started working on your political campaign right after I finished my service as a Navy SEALs Specialist, I knew you were bound for great things, Don. Especially after you actually managed to bring on the famous Celon Dusk."

He leaned in slightly.

Marcus:
"Our dream from then on was a reality."

His voice lowered slightly, his expression sharpening.

Marcus:
"And oh shit—the best news of all. I can't believe it's actually true! With your announcement later today, everything is going to change."

Don nodded, his excitement still electric, but his expression turning more serious.

Don Treagan:
"I know! I couldn't believe it either!"

Then he paused, taking a slow breath.

Don Treagan:
"But okay, okay… let's not get ahead of ourselves. I still have the commemoration of The Planetarium today, and you need to finalize those last two countries."

Marcus smirked.

Marcus:
"Alright. The Speaker and I made plans for it yesterday. It was... quite tiring."

Don raised an eyebrow, grinning knowingly.

Don Treagan:
"Ohoho. That's good to hear—you always have my full trust, after all."

Then his expression shifted slightly—just enough to make Marcus pause.

Don Treagan:
"Nevertheless, I am going to prepare for my speech. But before you go—"

His eyes flickered down toward Marcus's hand.

Don Treagan:
"Your promise ring. Do you still have it?"

Marcus blinked, then instinctively touched the purple ring on his finger.

His smirk faltered slightly.

Marcus:
"Oh? Yeah, man, Don. I always keep it close to me ever since we made that promise to unite the world together as partners. Don't worry about it. I will never forget our promise."

Don leaned back in his chair, letting out a slow exhale.

Don Treagan:
"Good."

His grin returned, but his tone carried a quiet weight.

Don Treagan:
"You know that's why I love you, man—platonically, of course. You have never let me down, and I intend to do the same."

Marcus nodded, his smirk returning.

Marcus:
"Yes, boss! See ya soon."

He turned and left, shutting the door behind him.

As the door clicked shut, Don sat in silence for a moment, his fingers spinning the ring again.

Then he muttered under his breath.

Don Treagan:
"At least I know you'll be safe, Marcus… I really hope it doesn't go bad later."

The Speech
The UN Hall was packed, every seat filled with representatives from every nation.

Journalists lined the walls, cameras broadcasting the event live across the world.

As the American delegation entered, the room erupted into applause.

Sofi walked ahead, taking the podium behind a 10cm-thick ballistic glass shield.

She smiled, raising her voice.

Sofi:
"Our wonderful friends from around the world, may we present the President of the United States of America and our Grand Chancellor of the Terra Space Force—Don John Treagan!"

The hall thundered with applause.

All delegates rose to their feet, clapping as Don made his way to the center podium.

Scenes of cheering citizens flashed across screens from different countries.

Don smiled, placing his hands on the podium.

Then, his voice boomed through the speakers.

Don Treagan:
"My fellow citizens of our beautiful planet.
This is a historic day. A day that will be marked as the Day of Global Unification, all because we are united toward one goal—to reach the stars and beyond together as one human race!"

The crowd erupted again.

Don continued.

Don Treagan:
"With your trust, we have built a world without wars, a world without borders, a world united by one vision.
"And as you all know about our plans for The Planetarium, we have one more announcement that will change everything."

A hush fell over the hall.

The tension in the air was palpable.

Don Treagan:
"Today, I am revealing this to the world.
"I can confirm that we have finally found extraterrestrial life in our galaxies and beyond."

The room gasped.

A ripple of shock coursed through the hall, spreading like wildfire.

Delegates turned to each other, whispering, stunned.

"Is this real?"
"Aliens exist?"
"We are not the only life forms?"

The room erupted into chaos.

And Marcus, standing beside Sofi, grinned widely.

Marcus:
(Thinking) "And they call me a hidden man-child? Who wouldn't be freaking excited hearing this??? Aliens are fucking real!"

He chuckled, watching the media frenzy unfold.

But as the world reacted in shock and excitement—

The Assassin in the Shadows
High above the chaos of the UN hall, in an unguarded section of the rafters, a green flame ignited on the floor.

The fire twisted and swirled, unnatural and silent, before two dark, slender hands reached through, pressing against the ground. A figure emerged, slowly rising from the green inferno.

She stepped forward, her body covered in flickering emerald flames, though they never consumed her skin-tight suit. The material seemed to shimmer and shift, adapting to the light around her—a living shadow, concealed in plain sight.

Her fingers twitched, and the flames surrounding her shifted.

A sniper rifle materialized, forming piece by piece from the fire—sleek, deadly, and eerily silent.

Two bullets hovered beside her, pulsing faintly with the same ethereal green glow.

She caught one between her fingers, rolling it lazily before sliding it into the chamber.

???:
"Hmmm… looks like this is all I can conjure up in this place. Two should be enough."

Her voice was soft, almost amused, but there was a sharpness beneath it—a cold, calculated confidence.

She moved swiftly, making her way across the beams, finding the perfect vantage point above the podium.

Below, the hall was chaos—delegates arguing, journalists scrambling for information, security struggling to maintain order.

And in the center of it all, Don John Treagan stood tall, basking in the global attention.

A perfect target.

The assassin laid down into position, adjusting the rifle against her shoulder.

She peered through the scope, lining up her shot.

Her green flames dimmed, simmering low so they wouldn't give away her position.

The crosshairs locked onto the President's head.

She took a slow breath.

One shot.

That was all it would take.

Her finger hovered over the trigger.

Down below, Marcus scanned the room.

The energy was shifting, the tension morphing into something else.

A familiar feeling crawled up his spine—something was wrong.

His instincts, honed from years in the field, screamed at him.

The hall was too chaotic. Too loud.

And chaos was always the perfect cover for disaster.

Marcus's eyes flicked across the room, watching, analyzing.

A sudden glint of green light caught the corner of his vision.

It disappeared just as quickly.

His muscles tensed.

He turned his head upward, focusing on the high beams of the hall.

There.

A figure. A gun barrel.

A sniper.

Marcus's heart slammed in his chest.

No hesitation. No second-guessing.

He knew exactly what was about to happen.

And he only had seconds to stop it.

His body moved before his mind could think.

He lunged forward, sprinting toward the President.

His voice roared over the chaos.

Marcus:
"DON! GET DOWN—RIGH—"!

The First Shot – Chaos Unleashed
The shot rang out.

Time seemed to warp and twist as the bullet tore through the air—a streak of green fire, moving faster than thought itself.

A deafening crack split through the hall.

Then—impact.

The ballistic enclosure exploded, the reinforced shield shattering like glass as the green flames detonated on contact.

A shockwave rippled outward, sending people stumbling, falling—screaming. Don flew back from the exploded glass seemingly unharmed with a soft purple glow around him.

However, others were not so lucky. The force slammed into Marcus, launching him backward like a ragdoll.

Air left his lungs.

He barely registered the moment his back crashed into a table, the wood splintering beneath him.

Pain flared up his spine, his vision flickering between black and white flashes.

For a second—just one—all he could hear was static.

Then—

Chaos erupted.

Screams. Shouts. Footsteps pounding against the floor.

The hall erupted into mayhem as people trampled over each other, desperate to escape.

The Secret Service agents around the Heads of State had been completely knocked out from the explosion, their bodies motionless on the floor.

Some were groaning, barely conscious. Others weren't moving at all.

The sprinklers activated, raining down over the burning wreckage, trying to snuff out the eerie green smoke quivering in the air.

Sofi shielded her face, coughing as she forced her way through the panicked crowd.

On stage, Don John Treagan was still down.

He had been blown backward, now slumped weakly against the padded wall behind the ruined podium.

His chest rose and fell unevenly. He was still breathing. Barely.

Marcus's vision spun as he forced himself to move.

His ribs screamed in protest. His head was still ringing.

But none of that mattered.

His instincts screamed at him—this wasn't over.

His head snapped upward.

Through the thickening smoke, he could just barely make out—

A silhouette. A rifle. A second shot about to be fired.

His blood ran cold.

Marcus:
"Fuck—"

He pushed off the shattered table, his feet pounding against the floor as he sprinted forward.

He barely processed Don stirring slightly, groaning, still trying to recover from the impact.

Marcus:
"Don! GET DOWN!"

His voice cut through the chaos, but it was already too late.

The second shot was coming.

Marcus's heart slammed against his ribs as he reached the steps of the podium—

His body moving before his mind could think.

One last push.

One last chance.

He leapt.

The Second Shot – A Hero's Final Moment
CRACK.

The second shot ripped through the air, splitting the echoes of panic.

Marcus had already prepared for the worst.

His body moved on instinct, his training engrained into every fiber of his being—

But this time, there was no time to counter, no time to push Don away, no time for anything but one last decision.

Time slowed.

Marcus was mid-air, his body suspended between action and fate.

His right foot barely touched the ground.

The bullet was coming.

He couldn't stop it.

But he could intercept it.

Every muscle in his body tightened, his adrenaline spiking beyond reason.

Marcus:
(Thinking) "No time to push him out of the way."

The sniper's aim was dead-on.

A perfect kill shot.

If he moved an inch differently, Don John Treagan was dead.

Marcus adjusted mid-air, his body twisting—not toward Don, but in front of him.

A human shield.

And then—

Impact.

The Disembark
CRACK.

The sniper round lodged itself deep into Marcus's right temple.

A shockwave of searing pain rippled through his skull—but only for a moment.

Then—nothing.

No pain. No sensation. Just… silence.

His body jerked violently, the force of the impact slamming him into Don.

SLAM!

Both men collapsed onto the ground, the momentum sending them sprawling across the ruined stage.

The purple barrier—a strange energy field that had briefly flickered to life around them—disappeared.

For a moment, the world was still.

The screaming. The chaos. The gunfire. It all faded.

"Marcus? Oh fuck—MARCUS!"

Don scrambled up, his hands gripping Marcus's shoulders, his face a mask of pure terror.

Don Treagan:
"Oh fuck, Marcus, are you alive?!"

Footsteps pounded toward them.

Sofi.

She skidded to a stop, her breath hitching as she saw Marcus motionless on the ground.

Her heart clenched.

Sofi:
"MARCUS! PLEASE GET UP!"

She dropped to her knees, grabbing his face, her fingers trembling.

Sofi:
"MARCUS, GET UP! PLEASE! You have to make it—our promise together! I cannot do it without you, you can't leave me!"

Don's chest heaved, his hands gripping Marcus's arm so tightly his knuckles turned white.

Marcus's eyes flickered.

A weak gasp escaped his lips.

Slowly—he moved.

"I… I'm alive?"

Both Don and Sofi froze.

Their eyes widened as Marcus shifted, his body trembling as he slowly sat up.

Don Treagan:
"Wha—"!

Sofi's breath caught in her throat.

Sofi:
"How?!"

Marcus touched his temple.

His fingers brushed against the bullet—still embedded in his skull.

It should've been fatal.

But he was still here.

Breathing.

Alive.

His eyes flickered between them, a haze of shock and confusion settling in.

Marcus:
"I felt it… I felt it hit me. But I'm still—"

Then—

The burning began.

Emerald Flames Erupt
A spark of green light ignited from the bullet wound.

Then another.

Then—fire.

Marcus's entire body ignited in emerald flames, consuming him from head to toe.

The pain hit like a tsunami.

He screamed.

Marcus:
"AAAHHHHUUGGHHHHHHHH!"

His skin crackled, the fire spreading rapidly, burning too fast—too aggressively.

Sofi's eyes widened in horror.

Sofi:
"NO! MARCUS!"

Her hands flew to her mouth as she watched in helpless terror.

Don Treagan:
"WHAT THE HELL IS HAPPENING?!"

The flames weren't normal.

They weren't burning anything else—just Marcus.

He staggered backward, his feet stumbling across the stage, his hands clawing at his body as if trying to rip the fire away.

But it wouldn't stop.

Marcus gasped for air.

His lungs turned to fire.

His veins glowed, his flesh blackening, crumbling—

His nerves were searing away faster than they could register pain.

Residing his fate, in his last breath, he muttered to his best friend and lover.

Marcus:
"Im glad I could save you bo…"

His throat burned away, the world falling silent.

His eyes boiled in their sockets.

The last thing he saw was their faces—Don and Sofi, horrified, helpless, reaching for him.

His vision faded to black.

A Friend Turned to Ash
The flames died abruptly.

Marcus was gone.

Nothing but a pile of blackened remains remained where he once stood.

The sprinklers above rained down, clearing the smoke and fire, only to reveal…

Marcus's burnt body with a small tuft of golden hair lay untouched to his crisp blackened skull, a single piece of him in contrast to the charred body beneath it.

Sofi collapsed to her knees.

Her hands trembled over her lips, unable to speak.

Don stared.

His hands balled into fists, his jaw clenched, his chest rising and falling with ragged breaths.

His best friend. His brother.

Gone.

And there was nothing he could do.

A Watchful Assassin
Up in the rafters, the sniper lowered her rifle.

She had stayed long enough to confirm the kill.

Her eyes narrowed.

Her lips curled slightly— not into a smirk, but a scowl.

???:
"Shit… I killed the wrong guy."

She exhaled, tapping her fingers against the barrel.

???:
"Let's hope it's not a wasted effort. Maybe something will come of this… though I doubt it."

She glanced at the horrified figures below, then sighed.

Lifting her boot, she pressed it into the ground—

A green flame erupted beneath her feet.

Her body sank into it, vanishing into the fire.

The flames snuffed out instantly, leaving nothing behind.

The assassin was gone.

And down below—

The world had just lost one of its greatest men.

================================================================================
CHAPTER 2: To A New World
================================================================================

A Space of Sorrow
Darkness.

Endless. Boundless. Consuming.

Marcus floated in the void, weightless, formless.

Marcus: (Thinking)
"It's… it's so dark."

The pain was gone.

Or maybe it was still there, buried beneath the numbness of nothingness.

Marcus: (Thinking)
"Is this it? Have I finally died?"

His mind raced. Don. Sofi.

Were they alright? Had the sniper struck again?

Had his sacrifice meant anything?

The thoughts swirled, growing louder, echoing back at him in the endless abyss.

Marcus: (Thinking)
"Where am I? How can I still be thinking? Is this the afterlife? Full of darkness?"

For what felt like an eternity, there was no answer.

Then—

A single, white dot appeared.

Like a lone star blinking in the void.

Marcus's eyes widened.

Marcus: (Thinking)
"Wait… I can see? My eyes… they're working?"

He blinked. He could feel his eyelids move.

The small white dot shimmered.

Then another appeared. And another.

Suddenly—the sky around him erupted into an ocean of stars.

Marcus gasped, realization settling in.

Marcus: (Thinking)
"What is this place? I can see so many… stars? Am I in space? Is this my soul?"

His body drifted, the sensation strange yet familiar.

Like he was floating.

But no—he wasn't in empty space. He was… swimming.

Marcus moved his arms experimentally, feeling the strange viscous substance surrounding him.

It wasn't air.

It wasn't water.

It was something else.

A feeling tugged at his soul, deep and distant.

Then—

The stars shifted.

They pulled together, bending into the shape of an eye.

A vast, luminous white eye, glowing in the cosmic darkness.

It opened.

Marcus's breath hitched.

A presence loomed over him, ancient yet unknowable.

Was this… Heaven?

Or something else entirely?

He felt the weight of everything he lost crashing down on him.

His country. His goals. His friends.

It hurt.

Tears welled up in his eyes, floating away like tiny droplets of light.

Marcus: (Thinking)
"I wasn't finished yet… I still had so much to do."

The eye pulsed.

Then—

Marcus felt a force pulling him forward.

The eye widened, and he was suddenly rushing toward it, dragged through an unseen current.

His body lurched forward, head-first into the light.

For a split second, everything was pure white.

Then—

POP.

Re:Born
A bright turquoise glow flooded his vision.

His head broke the surface of something warm and thick, a liquid shifting around his tiny form.

Marcus gasped, sucking in his first breath—but something felt off.

His lungs felt smaller. His body felt weaker.

His limbs felt tiny.

He blinked rapidly, his vision adjusting to the soft luminescence around him.

Glowing bottles lined the walls, casting a serene light through the room.

The air was thick with the scent of something unfamiliar—something ancient.

Marcus's thoughts slammed to a halt.

Where the hell was he?

What had just happened?

And more importantly—

Why did his hands feel so small?

A New Life Begins
A mother's cry and the sharp wail of a newborn baby echoed through the Ether Delivery Room.

Elda lay back, exhausted yet relieved, as her body shuddered from the intensity of childbirth.

Her breathing steadied, and a soft smile of victory crept onto her lips.

Elda:
"Ry… our baby!"

Her voice was breathless, but filled with warmth.

Beside her, Ryker gripped her hand tighter, his own excitement barely contained.

Ryker:
"Yes! My beautiful! We finally did it! You finally did it!"

His voice shook slightly, a mix of adrenaline, overwhelming pride, and love.

The priest, an older man clad in flowing robes adorned with intricate etheric markings, gently cradled the newborn in his arms.

The baby squirmed and wailed, his small hands grasping at the air.

The priest turned toward the new parents, his face calm yet reverent.

Priest:
"Oh, blessed couple—congratulations! It's a boy!"

For a moment, there was silence.

Then—

Ryker:
"A BOY? YA-HOOO!!!"

His entire body jolted with excitement, his deep, boisterous laugh filling the room.

He jumped like a child, fists clenched, his elation completely unrestrained.

Ryker:
"Our first baby boy, Elda!"

His eyes sparkled as he turned back to the priest.

Ryker:
"Can we hold him?"

He grinned eagerly, eyes locked onto the tiny bundle in the priest's arms.

The priest chuckled, shaking his head.

Priest:
"In due time, blessed couple. We must first perform the Ether Ritual. It will only take a moment."

Ryker nodded eagerly, his anticipation barely contained.

Ryker:
"Alright, alright! No rush—take your time. Elda, rest for a bit, I got this!"

Elda, still catching her breath, smiled fondly at her husband's enthusiasm.

Elda:
"You're more excited than the baby, Ry."

Ryker beamed, clearly unbothered by the comment.

The Ether Ritual
The priest carefully carried the crying newborn over to a small, earthen bathtub carved directly into the floor.

A nurse approached, carrying a sealed vial filled with glowing turquoise liquid.

She uncorked it, and the room was immediately filled with a soft, soothing energy.

The priest poured the Ether slowly over the baby's tiny form, washing away the remnants of blood and fluid from the birth.

The moment the liquid touched the infant's skin, a faint glow pulsed across his body.

The baby twitched, his cries momentarily stopping, as though he had just felt something… profound.

A connection.

A link between himself and the world's mana.

The priest continued gently cleansing the baby, ensuring every drop of Ether seeped into his pores.

Slowly—the crying subsided.

The newborn relaxed in the shallow bath, his tiny hands floating weightlessly.

Priest:
"The connection is formed. The ritual is complete."

Lifting the baby out, the priest wrapped him in a soft cloth, drying him completely.

With great care, he turned and presented him to his parents.

Priest:
"Mr. and Mrs. Redimir—I bring to you your new son."

First Moments
Elda's eyes glistened as she reached out.

Elda:
"He's… so small."

Her fingers brushed against his soft cheek, and the baby twitched slightly at her touch.

She let out a tired laugh, pressing her forehead gently against the infant's.

Elda:
"Ry, look at him… he's perfect."

Ryker, still brimming with excitement, crouched beside her.

He grinned, reaching out with one finger—

And the baby immediately grabbed it.

Ryker froze.

Then grinned even wider.

Ryker:
"Oh-ho! What a strong grip he has! Such a fighter!"

He chuckled, watching his son's tiny fingers cling to him with surprising strength.

His laughter softened, his voice dropping into something more gentle, more tender.

Ryker:
"And look—he has both our hair colors!"

His hand brushed through the baby's tiny strands, his dark hair intertwined with a soft golden twirl.

Elda's eyes widened slightly.

Elda:
"Oh my… you're right. He really does!"

She turned back to Ryker, her smile warm, radiant.

Elda:
"What shall we name him?"

Ryker paused, stroking his chin in thought.

Then, his eyes lit up.

Ryker:
"It would be nice to have another 'Ry' in the family, to take care of you too!"

His grin softened into something full of love and pride.

Ryker:
"How's about… Ryfel?"

Elda laughed softly, the name rolling off her tongue.

She gazed back down at their son, her heart full.

Elda:
"Ryfel… I like it."

She kissed the baby's forehead gently, whispering with love.

Elda:
"Hello, my sweet little Ryfel Redimir. Welcome to our family."

A New Mind in an Infant's Body
Inside the newborn's mind, chaos reigned.

His consciousness surged, thoughts crashing into each other like violent waves in a storm.

This wasn't instinct.

This wasn't a newborn's blank slate.

This was the mind of a man—Marcus Seneca's mind.

Marcus (Thinking):
"What… what the hell just happened?!"

His body felt wrong.

His limbs were weak. Tiny.

The voices around him sounded foreign, their words unintelligible.

The air was thick, carrying a scent that was not the sterile cleanliness of a hospital.

His eyes, though unfocused, took in flickering lantern lights, stone walls, and wooden beams—

None of it felt right.

Marcus (Thinking):
"Where am I?! This… this isn't America!"

Panic clawed at his mind.

The architecture, the robes people were wearing, the way they spoke—

Nothing resembled modern civilization.

There were no machines, no beeping monitors, no doctors in white coats.

This wasn't a hospital.

This wasn't even the right century.

Marcus (Thinking):
"I'm not in a hospital, I'm not in America… WHERE THE HELL AM I?"

His body squirmed, his tiny hands clenching instinctively as he tried to move.

But all that came out was—

A baby's cry.

A Horrifying Realization
Marcus's heart pounded, but his body betrayed him.

His head bobbed weakly, barely able to lift itself.

A pair of arms cradled him gently—a woman's arms.

His mother?

His mind raced, trying to process everything.

Marcus (Thinking):
"I don't understand what they're saying… and what the hell was that bath?!"

The glowing liquid still clung to his skin, leaving behind a tingling warmth.

Marcus (Thinking):
"Shining Shampoo? What the—wait no—focus!"

His thoughts derailed even further as he realized something even worse.

His tiny hands twitched.

His fingers were stubby. Weak.

His limbs barely worked.

Marcus (Thinking):
"No… No, no, no—"

And then—

His breath caught.

The moment of true horror arrived.

Marcus (Thinking):
"Wait… the light I came out from that looked like I was at the end of a tunnel—that was a…VAGINA?!"

His baby face twisted slightly, a mixture of existential panic and sheer disbelief.

And then—a shadow loomed over him.

The priest.

Marcus's instincts kicked in, his Navy-trained mind still wired for danger.

Marcus (Thinking):
"Shit! Is he trying to attack me?! BLOCK—wait, why is he smiling?"

The priest raised a small pouch in his hands.

Marcus (Thinking):
"Wait, what is that—?"

Before he could process anything else—

A fine dust rained down onto his tiny face.

His body immediately relaxed.

His limbs stopped twitching.

His thoughts screamed in protest.

Marcus (Thinking):
"Wait! No! I still have questions—don't you dare make me sleep—"

His vision blurred.

His tiny body grew heavier.

The darkness returned.

A New Home
The journey back to the Redimir Estate was slow and peaceful.

Ryker pushed Elda's wheelchair with one hand, his other hand resting protectively on her shoulder. She cradled newborn Ryfel, swaddled snugly in soft cloth, his tiny chest rising and falling with gentle breaths.

Before them stood their home—a simple yet elegant manor, its stone and wood construction sturdy yet welcoming.

The floor was a mix of hardened clay and stone, designed to retain warmth through the seasons.

Beyond the manor, trees and lush greenery stretched across the land, their vast farmland expanding for hundreds of meters, their neighbors' homes dotted in the distance.

A tall stone wall enclosed their estate, a sign of both protection and prosperity.

And at the entrance, carved into polished oak, stood their family crest and title:
"Lord Redimir, Count of the Farmland District."

Ryker stopped before the door, taking a deep breath.

He stepped forward and raised his palm.

The earthen locks shifted, moving in perfect harmony, each mechanism clicking open with an almost musical rhythm.

With a gentle push of his palm, the sealed door unlocked fully, swinging open on its own.

With a final motion, he lifted his hand, and the earth beneath them shifted, forming a smooth ramp leading inside.

As they entered, a familiar face greeted them at the door.

A young maid with auburn hair and bright green eyes, her uniform neatly pressed, her expression beaming with warmth.

Milal:
"Good evening, Count and Countess! Congratulations on your newborn son!"

She bowed deeply, her voice genuinely happy.

Ryker:
"Hoho! Good evening to you too, Milal!"

He grinned widely, his usual boisterous energy returning.

Ryker:
"The birth was a beautiful success! Look at my stunning wife—and my handsome son!"

He posed dramatically, showcasing his family like a proud merchant advertising his finest goods.

Elda chuckled tiredly, shaking her head.

Elda:
"Now, now, Ry. As excited as I am, the priest said we need to rest."

She turned to Milal with a gentle smile.

Elda:
"Thank you so much for taking care of our home while we were away. Would you mind preparing our bed and setting up Ryfel's room before you leave?"

Milal nodded immediately.

Milal:
"Of course, Your Countess! Your rooms have already been prepared, with your son's nursery just next to the master bedroom. A warm meal has also been set inside for both of you, and I've prepared grain porridge with milk for Little Ry."

Elda:
"Splendid. You are truly a lifesaver, Milal. Thank you. We'll see you again tomorrow—enjoy the rest of your evening."

Milal bowed deeply, smiling.

Milal:
"It is my joy and pleasure to serve the Count and Countess! I shall see you tomorrow."

As she turned to leave, Ryker gave her a squinted look, his brows lifting mischievously.

With a subtle tilt of his head, he silently mouthed something to her.

Ryker: (Eyebrows wiggling)
"Is it… doneeee?"

Milal smirked slightly, her expression cheeky and knowing.

She gave a quick hidden thumbs-up before gracefully stepping out the door.

Ryker chuckled to himself, shaking his head in amusement as he waved his hand once more.

The door closed behind her, the locks sealing shut.

Ryker turned to Elda, his voice softening.

Ryker:
"Alright, my dear, let me take both of you to the rooms behind."

He bent down, gently lifting Elda into his arms, carrying her with effortless strength.

She sighed contently, resting against his chest, still cradling their newborn.

The house was warm, the air filled with the rich scent of baked bread and simmering soup.

As Ryker stepped into the master bedroom, Elda sighed happily.

Elda:
"Mmm… that smells delightful. Thank you, Ry, for carrying me."

Her fingers lightly traced his chest, a habit of affection whenever he held her.

Elda:
"I'll have a small meal to regain my strength… Please make a nice crib for Ryfel in the next room."

Ryker nodded, kissing her forehead.

Ryker:
"Of course, my dear."
