# PART 1: WORLD SETTING - CRITH

## Geography & Kingdoms

### The Three Dominant Kingdoms

- Multiple factions: mercenary guilds, mage clans with no allegiance

**3. Runevia (The Empire of Conquest)**

## Magic System

### The Five Elements of Mana

All newborns are washed with **Ether** during the Ether Ritual to open their Mana Pores, allowing them to connect with the five forms of mana.

**1. Earth Magic**
- Most common and easiest to learn
- Surrounds practitioners everywhere
- Different types of earth require different skill levels to manipulate
- House Redimir specializes in controlling multiple forms of soil and stone
- Used for construction, farming, barriers, and combat

**2. Water Magic**
- Trickier because flow must always be considered
- Requires understanding currents and momentum
- Can be frozen into ice
- Used for irrigation, cooling, and versatile combat applications

**3. Air/Wind Magic**
- Unpredictable - only moves when it wants to
- If wind is too strong, air magic becomes uncontrollable
- Doesn't obey like other elements - flows freely
- Used for speed enhancement, flight, and disruption

**4. Light Magic**
- Everywhere during day, faint at night
- Ancient discovery: mana in light only moves in straight lines
- Follows refraction laws
- Used for party tricks, illusions, blinding enemies, and tracking
- Advanced use: creating illusions, multiple reflections

**5. Fire Magic**
- Most dangerous and hardest to control
- Unlike other elements, fire isn't stable - it spreads
- Once it spreads too much, it becomes nearly impossible to control
- Only element that consumes rather than just moves
- Used for offense, heating, and destruction

### Magic Principles

**Mana Connection**: Magic isn't about commanding elements but working with them - listening first, then guiding.

**Mana Pores**: Opened by Ether Ritual at birth, allowing connection to elemental mana.

**Material Understanding**: Knowing the composition of materials allows better control.

**Environmental Factors**: Wind conditions, time of day, terrain all affect magic effectiveness.
