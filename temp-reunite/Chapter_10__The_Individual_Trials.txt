Chapter 10: The Individual Trials

The Blacksmith District had just been dismantled by Ryfel, and now, the crowd waited with bated breath. The Farmland District fans were ecstatic, but the rest of the spectators—from the other districts—were still in shock at the spectacle they had just witnessed.

As the dust began to settle, officials hurried to the center of the arena, their faces filled with uncertainty. The previous battles had been intense, with every district’s best fighters thrown into a violent series of clashes.

Tournament Official (addressing the crowd, voice loud and official):

"Ladies and gentlemen, this tournament has taken an unexpected turn. As you’ve all witnessed, nearly every district has been knocked out, leaving us with... well... not much left standing."

The official paused, letting the murmurs of the crowd die down before continuing.

Tournament Official (clearing throat):
 "It’s clear we cannot continue with the other trials of Invention and Team, as nearly all fighters have been incapacitated. We’ll need time to clear the battlefield, but there’s no way forward without a winner.

Therefore, we’ve decided to move straight to the final individual trials. The winner of this final matches will be declared our Champion, and will claim victory for their district. Uhhh- Mainly either Farmland or Magic District."

The crowd’s reactions were a mix of confusion and excitement. It was clear now—the battle for first place would come down to one final duel.

Tournament Official (raising his voice, trying to settle the crowd):
 "We will give the remaining competitors an hour to prepare. During this time, we will clean up the arena and set the stage for the final fight. I ask that everyone remain patient as we set up the battlefield for the ultimate contest."

The crowd roared, some cheering in excitement while others murmured disappointment at the sudden turn of events. 

Meanwhile, in the midst of the murmurs of the crowd, the shadowy figures come together to discuss.



“We need more time, this tournament was supposed to be longer to distract everyone.”

“Find one of the districts to turn, so that we can stall them longer.” They whispered.



Tournament Official (speaking clearly as he pulled out the first slip):
 "The first match will be between Bram Ironfoot versus Kriscila Glavni."

The crowd murmured, some excited at the thought of the two teammates battling each other, others curious about how this match would play out. But as the next name was drawn, the atmosphere shifted.

Tournament Official (pulling another slip):
 "And the second match will be Dain Luthren versus Ryfel Redimir."

The announcement sent a ripple of unease through the crowd. Everyone knew that Dain and Ryfel were leagues apart, and it seemed almost like a foregone conclusion that Ryfel would win.



Bram vs Kriscila

The arena buzzed with energy as the Farmland District team stepped onto the battlefield. The match between Bram Ironfoot  and Kriscila Glavni was about to begin, and the audience’s anticipation was palpable. They had seen them fight together, but this was something different—a battle of equals.

Bram (grinning, cracking his knuckles):
 "You knoooow, Kriscila. I never been one to hit a lady before. Especially one as beautiful as you."

Kriscila (smirking, her chains floating around her):
 "Pffft, I have seen you fight, I don’t think you can even hit me at all. But thanks for the complement."

Bram:
 "Weeeell, you would definitely be in for a surprise! Besides I’m not much of those feminist like my Grandpa. I would prefer to treat you right.

What saaaay if I win, you’d go on a date with me?"

Kriscila:
 "Hah Bram, you can stop trying so hard. I am not interested, buuut maybe if you can win against Ryfel?"

Bram (pouted):
 "Oh cmonnnn. That’s too high a bar!"

From the stands, a proud Grandfather shouts across the arena.

Grandpa Ironfoot (yelling):
 "Cmon Grandson! Go and kick her ass!"

Bram (big grin):
 "Yes Grandpa! Will do!" Turning back to Kris, “Hahaha, there he goes with his feminist ideals.”

The gong rang and the fight began. Bram, wearing his rock armor, was a mountain in motion. He slammed his fists into the ground, sending shockwaves toward Kriscila. The force was so great that the ground shuddered beneath them, but Kriscila was already moving—too quick for him to land a hit.

She swung her chains around, using them to propel herself into the air, dodging Bram’s heavy punches. She wasn’t aiming to attack just yet; she was sizing him up, looking for openings while keeping Bram’s strikes at bay.

Kriscila (laughing lightly as she swung around an earth pillar she made):
 "Is that all you’ve got, Bram?"

Bram (grinning, charging after her):
 "I will catch up to you!"

He swung again, but once again Kriscila wasn’t there. Her chain wrapped around a another self-conjured pillar, pulling her out of his range in a smooth arc. She landed behind him and whipped her chain toward the bottom of his armor, aiming to chip in and trip him. But Bram braced himself with hardened earth, resisting the force of her strikes.

Bram turned, his heavy fists came crashing down again, but this time Kriscila’s chains formed a barrier in front of her. She flung them out in a defensive move, wrapping them around Bram’s arms to redirect his force. The chains coiled tightly around his limbs, but Bram’s raw power was too much. He ripped free, slamming his fist toward Kriscila again.

But Kriscila was already gone, her chains retracting and pulling her out of the way in an instant. She spun, slashing at his back, making quick, precise strikes.

He wasn’t going to give her the freedom to maneuver like this much longer. A battle of attrition between an uncatchable target and an immovable force.

He began to lure her in, acting as though he was tired, hoping to bait her into overextending herself. Kriscila took the bait, diving in for another strike. But just as she went to whip her chain around his side, Bram twisted, spinning around and slamming his fist into the ground.

Bram (smirking):
 "Gotcha!"

From beneath Kriscila’s feet, the earth exploded—stone pillars rose rapidly, trapping her within a sudden stone cage. Kriscila's chains wrapped around the bars, pulling, trying to break free, but Bram had cut off her escape. The earth was solid, and her usual agility was slowed by the stone prison.

Bram (standing above her, panting):
 "Thought you could keep dodging? Not this time."

But Kriscila, never one to back down, smiled, despite the pressure of the stone.

Kriscila (laughing, her chains writhing in frustration):
 "You know, you’re not the only one who can get serious."

Bram slid forward, thinking the fight was nearly won, but Kriscila wasn’t finished. She quickly adjusted her stance, and with a snap of her fingers, the chains around her body began to shift, becoming more fluid—almost like serpents, coiling around her.

Kriscila (her voice full of challenge):
 "Alright, Bram. Let’s both stop playing."

In an instant, Kriscila unleashed her full strength, her chains shifting into a Medusa-like state, extending and whipping around her with incredible speed and precision. They lashed out like deadly whips, circling her body and crashing against the earth like whirling blades. She traveled along the ground silthering like a giant half snake made of chains. Swift and insanely deadly.

Bram barely had time to react as one of the chains wrapped around his arm, pulling him off balance. Kriscila was now a blur, using her chains to create multiple strikes at once, making it impossible for Bram to block them all. Each lash cut deep, her speed far outpacing his ability to tank and repair. She struck at his armor’s side, legs, and arms—each hit coming faster than he could defend.

Bram (voice strained):
 "What the hell Kris! Since when could you do this?"

Kriscila’s chain Medusa form wasn’t just about offense—it was also about defense. As Bram swung a powerful fist toward her, she wrapped her chains around his arm, using it to redirect his force, sending him stumbling.

Kriscila (proud of herself):
 "Seems like your armor is gone! Told you, you can’t win against my speed!”

Bram (his voice filled with determination):
 "Alright, Kriscila... You wanna fight with speed? Here it comes."

From the stands, Grandpa Ironfoot shouted with an impulsive fury.

Grandpa Ironfoot (shouting, full of energy):
 "You dolt of a lovable grandson! You can't be losing to a woman! Go, go! I permit you to use it!"

Kriscila and Dain, watching from the sidelines, exchanged bewildered looks, trying to understand what was happening.

Kriscila (raising an eyebrow):
 "What do you mean by ‘use it’?"

Dain (scratching his head, still confused):
 "I thought he was already going all out... what’s this about?"

Both a bewildered Kriscila and Dain, stood there watching. As Bram started to come out of his armor, standing atop of it like it was a hill. His signature large weighted gauntlets and boots, he took it out and dropped it from the top.

BOOM!

The sound echoed through the arena like earthquaking roar, shaking the very foundation of the battlefield. 

As the dust settled, Bram’s limbs, long concealed beneath the heavy gauntlets and boots, now revealed themselves—unmistakably toned with muscle, each one sculpted to perfection, veins visibly running beneath the skin like a network of hardened steel cables. An unbelievably ripped body shone in the sun.

Kriscila (doubting herself):
 "Oh wow… That’s kinda ho-"

Girls in the stands:
 "OH MY GOSH! He is SO HOT!"

They squealed and squirmed looking at Bram’s ironclad body.

He covered his limbs with earth and hardened it up to the point of impenetrable density.

Kriscila, still in her Medusa chain form, narrowed her eyes, watching as Bram began his transformation. Her chains whirred with anticipation, readying themselves for the next round.

Bram (grinning, his voice loud and powerful):
 "Alright, Kris. You wanted speed vs speed? Now, let's see if you can keep up."

Kriscila (grinning, her chains hissing in the air):
 "So this is your real form? Not bad, Bram. Not bad at all."

The arena held its breath. And then—it happened.

With a burst of motion, Bram shot forward, his speed a blur, his hardened fists cutting the air like a crashing wave. The sheer force behind his movement shook the ground beneath him, and Kriscila was already dodging, but just barely.

He crashed into the wall behind her, a solid crater appeared below the stands. The crowd gasped at his pure strength and speed.

Bram (walking out of the walled crater, undamaged):
 "Ahhh shit, sorry everyone, I haven’t used this in a while."

Bram was faster than anyone had ever seen him before. He wasn’t just relying on raw power—he had shown a new level of speed, synchronized with his strength, and his muscles surged with an intensity that possibly even Kriscila’s chains couldn’t match.

As Kriscila’s chains lashed out toward his legs, Bram’s reflexes kicked in, dodging with unbelievable precision. He was a blur, his movements so fast that the audience could barely track him.

The crowd was already on its feet, murmuring in shock. It was like watching two forces of nature clash—each one moving so quickly that the arena was almost frozen in time, unsure who would come out on top.

But as Kriscila tried to outpace him, Bram’s speed didn’t slow. He dodged a chain strike with a fluid spin, his body moving with a flow that seemed to defy the laws of physics. The shockwaves from his movement were unprecedented, leaving behind a blurred trail in his wake.

Bram (his voice rising, full of confidence):
 "Come on, Kris! Keep up!"

With a sudden surge of power, Bram closed the distance, using his speed to dart around Kriscila’s chains. Every swing of her chains became a tool for his own movement, using them as footholds to dart around her, closing the distance faster than she could react.

In a move that left the crowd gasping, Bram reached out, grabbed one of Kriscila’s chains, and with a single savage strike, cut it in half with his bare hands.

Kriscila (eyes widening, impressed but focused):
 "Shit, you’re faster than I thought..."

As Kriscila struggled to get her bearings, Bram took full advantage.

Her chain Medusa form, once of deadly defense and speed, was now being systematically dismantled. One by one, the chains on her body fell to the ground, rendered useless.

The final chains, wrapped around her arms, was all that remained. Kriscila, now back on the ground, back to where she was before she met Ryfel.

Kriscila (eyes flashing with determination, voice steady):
 "Alright, Bram... one last dance?"

Bram (nodding, his smile widening as he took his fighting stance):
 "You know it, Kris. Let’s end this."

With enjoyment in her eyes, she swung her own hardened chained fists at Bram.

Bram easily dodged, his body a blur. The arena seemed to hold its breath again, as the two danced around each other—Kriscila’s fists and chains slicing through the air, while Bram used his newfound speed to stay just ahead of her. 

Kriscila knew it was over the moment she went back to her original form. But in these last moments of battle, she was truly enjoying herself. As fists constantly collided, she threw out her final blow.

Kriscila:
 "Hah you win, end it!"

Bram launched his final fist straight towards Kris’ face, stopping right before it hit. The shockwave blowing past Kriscila slamming against the wall in a show of unstoppable force.

Kris’ hair danced beautifully in the wind of the blow, smiling as she admits defeat.

The Farmland District fans roared with approval, chanting Bram’s name as they witnessed his growth as a fighter.

Farmland District Fans (cheering, chanting):
 "BRAM! BRAM! BRAM!"

Ryfel (watching from the sidelines, nodding to himself):
 "That’s the strength I’ve been waiting to see. Great job, Bram."

Tournament Official (smiling, voice filled with respect):
"Ladies and gentlemen, the Farmland District has just witnessed one of the most impressive displays of strength and speed in this tournament. Bram Ironfoot, you have earned your victory!”



Ryfel vs Dain

Tournament Official (motioning to the battlefield):
“And, without further delay, let’s begin the next round! Dain Luthren and Ryfel Redimir, step forward for the next match!”

Dain strode out from the Farmland sidelines, his scaled armor—Ryfel’s design—clinking with each step, shrapnel chambers primed along his forearms and armor. In the noble stands, his father, Lord Luthren, leaned forward, his face a mask of cold expectation. Dain’s two fat elder brothers flanked him, their voices sharp and biting.



Lord Luthren (venomous):

“Remember! This is your last chance, Dain. Win, or you’re a stain on our name.”



Fat Elder Brother 1 (sneering):

“Don’t choke again, runt. Our family’s glory rides on you—don’t make us look worse.”



Fat Elder Brother 2 (mocking):

“If you lose to Redimir, you’re done. We’ll make sure you never forget it.”



Dain’s shoulders stiffened by his family, but he kept his gaze forward, locking eyes with Ryfel across the field. Ryfel stepped up, hooks glinting at his belt, his expression calm but sharp. The air thickened with tension as the crowd’s roar swelled.



Ryfel:

“Don’t listen to them Dain, you decide your own path.”



A deep, resonant gong rang out, echoing across the arena—the signal to fight.



Dain (grinning, happily but fierce):

“Heh yea, thanks Ry. Let’s do this. My way.”



Ryfel (nodding, steady):

“Show me what you’ve got.”



Dain charged forward, air hissing as shrapnel sticks burst from his scaled armor—sharp, wooden darts flying fast. Ryfel shifted, earth rippling under his feet to nudge him aside. The sticks stabbed into the ground behind him with a dull thud.



Ryfel (calm, watching closely):

“Not a bad opener. Keep it up.”



Dain grinned, dropping low and slamming a fist into the dirt. Basic earth magic kicked up a scatter of pebbles, a distraction aimed at Ryfel’s legs. Ryfel raised a thin stone wall, deflecting the spray, then dropped it flat to rush forward.



Dain fired a wider shrapnel burst—air magic pushing the sticks in a jagged arc. Ryfel ducked, wind flicking from his fingers to scatter the darts into the stands. The crowd yelped, ducking as the sticks rained down.



Ryfel (closing in, steady):

“Hoho you’re fast, Dain. But I’m faster.”



Ryfel tunneled under, earth parting silently, and erupted behind Dain. His hooks snapped out, latching onto Dain’s scaled shoulder. Dain spun mid-yank, countering with shrapnel spraying point-blank. 



Ryfel blew a large gust of wind from his mouth to disrupt the shrapnel, all while tossing a flashbang. Light flared, trying to blind Dain mid-swing.



Dain (laughing, covering his eyes):

“Hah! I’m not dumb like Bram to fall for that!”

Meanwhile, Bram sneezed in the waiting room, resting with a scowl.

Ryfel:

“I expected as much, but it’s already enough.”



A simple arm reversal was utilized, flipping Dain upside down in mid-air. Ryfel launched a swift and powerful kick to his gut. It sent Dain crashing meters away, skidding across the battlefield’s scarred dirt. He grunted, rolling to his feet, his scaled armor clinking. 



Dain (grunting):

“Gahhh, ok ok I know I know… I can’t fight you like this. Especially since you made this armor for me.



But I haven’t slacked Ry, I know I can beat you. Let me show you how, my way.”



He slammed both fists into the ground, basic earth magic pulling up small stone shards. The shards fused to his armor’s knuckles, forming jagged spikes. He grinned, shifting into a boxer’s stance, fists raised like a brawler ready to slug it out.



Dain (panting, fierce):

“Let’s get up close, Ry! I’m not done yet!”



He charged, air hissing as he swung a spiked fist, the stone spikes whistling with speed. Ryfel ducked, earth rippling to boost his dodge, but Dain followed with a quick jab—spikes grazing Ryfel’s arm, drawing a thin line of blood. Dain pressed the attack, throwing a flurry of punches, each hit backed by air magic to make the spikes hit harder.



Ryfel (calm, weaving through the blows):

“Boxing now? You’re full of surprises.”



Dain smirked, then clenched his fists tighter. Air compressed in his armor’s chambers, the spikes glowing faintly with pressure. He roared, unleashing a high-pressure shrapnel burst—the stone spikes launched off his knuckles in a shotgun-like spread, faster and heavier than his wooden darts, a small shockwave kicking up dust.



Dain (grinning, wild):

“Dodge this! Spiky Blaster!”



Ryfel dove to the side, wind gusting to deflect most of the spikes, but a few embedded into the ground where he’d stood, cracking the earth. He landed in a crouch, earth spiking up to cuff Dain’s legs in stone cuffs.



Ryfel (standing, steady):

“My goodness Dain, you have to stop naming your moves. Or least get better names!”



Dain laughed, straining against the stone cuffs, his scaled armor creaking as he broke free with a grunt. He charged again, fists raised in his boxer stance, stone spikes reforming on his knuckles with basic earth magic. He swung a wild haymaker, air hissing behind the punch. Ryfel sidestepped, earth boosting his speed, and drove a solid earth hardened punch to Dain’s ribs. The impact echoed, Dain staggering back, but he stayed on his feet, grinning through the pain.



Dain (wincing and panting):

“That all you got, Ry?!”



Ryfel nodded in admiration and went closing in. He feinted left, then slammed a fist into Dain’s jaw—hard enough to snap his head to the side. Dain stumbled, blood trickling from his lip, but he straightened up, fists raised again.



The crowd murmured, a mix of awe and unease rippling through the stands.



Spectator 1 (whispering):

“H-He can’t win… why’s he still trying?”



Spectator 2 (wincing):

“Oof, that’s gotta hurt… He is just outmatched!”



Dain lunged once again, throwing a flurry of spiked punches. Ryfel weaved through them, earth rippling to keep him steady, and countered with a knee to Dain’s gut. 



Dain doubled over, gasping, but forced himself upright, swinging again. Ryfel caught his arm, twisting it behind Dain’s back, and drove an elbow into his spine. Dain hit the dirt face-first, scaled armor scraping the ground.



The crowd winced collectively, some looking away. In the noble stands, Lord Luthren’s cold mask faltered, his eyes narrowing as Dain pushed himself up again, trembling but unyielding.



Fat Elder Brother 1 (muttering):

“He’s embarrassing us… just stay down, you disappointment!”



Fat Elder Brother 2 (frowning):

“Wait… he’s still going? Against that?”



Dain spat even more blood both from his mouth and nose, his grin fading but his eyes burning. He charged, slower now, spikes glinting as he threw a desperate jab. 



Ryfel sidestepped, grabbing Dain’s wrist, and slammed a palm strike into his chest. The force sent Dain skidding back, his scaled armor leaving gouges in the dirt. He hit a stone slab Ryfel conjured up, cracking it, and slumped for a moment—then stood again, fists up.



Ryfel (calm, but proud):

“Dain, you can’t win this. Stay down.”



Dain (gasping, defiant):

“Not… yet… I’m not their puppet… I’m not anyone’s plaything…



I will win on my own terms!”



The crowd’s murmurs grew louder, a mix of pity and respect. Kriscila, in the stands, clenched her chains, her expression torn—Dain’s stubbornness stirring memories of his cruelty, but also something else.



Kriscila (muttering):

“I understand now, but you don’t have to prove anything to anyone anymore Dain.”



Dain roared, air hissing as he fired another shrapnel burst—weaker, the spikes scattering unevenly. Ryfel deflected them with a gust, closing the gap in an instant. He drove a fist into Dain’s stomach, then an uppercut to his chin. 



Dain flew back, crashing into the dirt, his scaled armor completely dented and cracked, exposing his bruised body.



In the noble stands, Lord Luthren’s hands tightened on the railing. His sons exchanged glances, their sneers fading into something closer to shock.



Lord Luthren (quiet, grudging):

“He’s… still standing… against Redimir?”



Fat Elder Brother 1 (shaken):

“He’s taking hits I couldn’t…”

Dain pushed himself up one last time, swaying, bruised and blood dripping from his whole face. He raised his fists in exhaustion, and took a shaky step forward.

Fat Elder Brother 2 (shaken):

“St-Stop Redimir! Enough! Please stop!”

Ryfel sighed, dropping a sonic grenade. [BOOM!] The blast rocked Dain, sending him to his knees. Ryfel stepped forward, grabbing Dain’s collar.

Ryfel (pained but understanding):

“You are strong my friend… And no one can take that away from you.”

Ryfel covered his hand with hardened earth. With a final blow, he slapped Dain on his only armored shoulder with such force, the ground cratered with a shockwave.

Dain’s scaled armor shattered at the impact, pieces falling away to reveal his scarred, battered body beneath—years of abuse etched into his skin, deep gouges and faded marks from a lifetime of cruelty. 

But as the sun shone down, catching the broken scales, they gleamed brightly, no longer a shield of shame but a symbol of Dain’s unyielding conviction.

Dain stood, swaying, eyes half-open, blood streaking his face—knocked out on his feet, held up by sheer will.









The arena fell silent for a moment, the crowd slowly rising to their feet.



[Clap]



[Clap Clap Clap]



[Clap Clap Clap Clap Clap Clap Clap Clap Clap Clap Clap]



A large wave of claps echoing through the stands. Farmland’s green banners waved high, but the applause wasn’t just for the victor—it was for Dain, the broken noble who’d fought beyond his limits.



Ryfel stepped back, retracting his hooks, and walked away, his head low but pride in his eyes, for he did not want to take away the moment of Dain’s spirit. 



In the noble stands, the Luthrens watched, their faces streaked with tears. Lord Luthren’s cold mask shattered, his hands trembling as he gripped the railing. His sons, once sneering, now wept openly—shame and pride warring in their hearts.



Lord Luthren (choking, voice low):

“What… what have we done to him…?”



Fat Elder Brother 1 (sobbing, ashamed):

“He’s… he’s stronger than us… after all we put him through…”



Fat Elder Brother 2 (tears streaming, proud):

“Dain… y-you fought like a true Luthren… I’m so sorry…”

The sun beat down, casting Dain’s shadow long across the battlefield, his broken scaled armor glinting like a beacon. He’d lost the fight, but won something greater—his family’s respect, and his own freedom.

The cheers swelled again, but as Ryfel reached the edge of the arena, he glanced back at Dain, a faint smile on his lips.



Ryfel (muttering to himself):

“You’ll be alright, Dain. You’re stronger than they ever knew.”





Back in the Waiting Room



Medics rushed to Dain, helping him off the field as the crowd’s applause followed him—a rare honor for the defeated.



In the Farmland waiting room, Ryfel sat on a bench, wiping sweat from his brow. Dain was carried in, slumped but conscious, and set down on a crate nearby. He rubbed his jaw, a faint grin breaking through the pain.



Dain (waking, relieved):

“Guess I’m still me, huh?”



Ryfel glanced over, a small smile tugging at his lips. He stood, walking over to Dain, and offered a hand. Dain took it, letting Ryfel pull him up, their bond stronger than ever.



Ryfel (steady):

“You’re more than you think, Dain. You proved that out there.”

Kriscila watched as they all entered the waiting room together. Dain’s fall felt good—too good. 

She’d never forgotten how he’d bullied her as kids, mocking her, calling her weak. But seeing him stand through that beating, scars bared for all to see… it stirred something. Not forgiveness—not yet—but a crack in her resentment.

Her gaze shifted to Ryfel, lingering too long. The way he started to change everyone around him. For the better, just from the way he carried himself, steady, unshaken, but that care he had for all of them—it tugged at her. Her cheeks warmed, and she turned her head sharply to the side.

Bram burst into the room, a skewer of grilled meat in hand, his rock armor clanking as he moved. He grinned wide, oblivious to the tension.



Bram (chewing loudly):

“Hoooo shiiiiiit! Hell of a fight, Dain! They are still cheering for you out there! But also Ry, you’re not done yet—thirty minutes, and you’re up against me! Winner faces Champion Aurex!”



Ryfel raised an eyebrow, leaning back against the wall.



Ryfel (steady):

“Aurex, huh? Let’s make sure Farmland sends its best.”



Bram (grinning wider):

“That’s me, Ry! You’re tough, but I’m taking that shot!”



Dain (gruff):

“Don’t go easy on him, Bram. He’s a monster.”



Kriscila rolled her eyes, but a small smile crept onto her lips—she was warmed to the team, even if Dain still grated on her.



Kriscila (dry):

“Great. More bruises to watch.”





Bram vs Ryfel



The arena had been cleared, the battlefield swept of debris, though the scars of earlier fights remained etched in the dirt. 



The crowd’s excitement hadn’t faded—Farmland’s dominance in the tournament only fueled their hunger for the final. The Tournament Official stepped to the center, his voice booming over the stands.



Tournament Official (motioning to the field):

“The Contender Tournament’s final match! Ryfel Redimir versus Bram Ironfoot! The winner will face Champion Aurex for the title! Step forward!”



Ryfel emerged from the waiting room, his expression calm but sharp. 



Bram followed, cracking his knuckles, his rock armor gleaming under the sun. 



The crowd roared, green banners waving high, eager to see who would represent Farmland against the legendary Aurex.



Bram (grinning, fierce):

“No holding back, Ry! Let’s show ‘em what Farmland’s made of!”



Ryfel (nodding, steady):

“Wouldn’t have it any other way.”



The air thickened with anticipation as the two faced off, the gong poised to ring.



But from the stands, a gruff, familiar voice cut through the noise—Grandpa Ironfoot, leans over the railing with a wild grin, his voice booming over the crowd.



Grandpa Ironfoot (shouting, proud):

“Bram, my boy! Skip the warm-up—go straight to fast-muscle-fighter-form or whatever! Show ‘em the Ironfoot strength! After this, we’re gonna be the new kings of Farmland!”



In the noble section, Ryker let out a deep laugh, Elda, beside him, snickered into her hand, her eyes sparkling with amusement. Milal, ever fiery, stood up, pointing at Grandpa Ironfoot with a scowl.



Milal (yelling back, fierce):

“Shut it, old man! Ryfel’s gonna kick ass again—and besides! We only have 1 King ya idiot! Our districts have Lords!”



Ryker (laughing louder):

“BAHAHAHA! That is true my dear Milal! Show him the Redimir way son!”



The crowd buzzed with laughter, but the Tournament Official stepped forward, raising a hand, his voice sharp.



Tournament Official (stern):

“Hush and shush you two! Silence in the stands, or I’ll clear you all out! Let the fighters speak with their fists!”



The stands quieted, though Grandpa Ironfoot sat back with a smug grin. On the field, Bram chuckled, rolling his shoulders. He reached up, unstrapping his rock armor piece by piece, letting it fall to the ground with heavy thuds. 



Underneath, his true form emerged, his ‘fast-muscle-fighter-form’—toned vieny muscles gleaming with sweat, his body leaner, faster, built for speed and power. He hardened his limbs with earth.



Bram (grinning, serious):

“Alright, Grandpa’s got a point. Serious from the start, Ry—let’s see whether you can see me!”



Ryfel tilted his head, a faint smirk on his lips as he adjusted his hooks, his stance unshaken.



Ryfel (calm, steady):

“I’m always serious, Bram. Let’s see what you’ve got.”



The crowd roared again, the tension snapping tight as the gong rang out, echoing across the arena—the final fight had begun.



Bram disappeared in a blur, his speed a streak across the battlefield as he charged straight at Ryfel. But Ryfel was ready, already with his own plans. He tossed a flashbang into the air, light flaring to blind Bram mid-dash, and dropped a sonic mine at his feet. As the mine hummed, Ryfel dove into the earth, tunneling beneath the surface in an instant.



Bram (squinting, growling):

“Damn ya tricks, Ry!”



The flashbang’s light faded, but the sonic mine detonated—[BOOM!]—a shockwave rippling out, catching Bram as he skidded to a stop. 



He stumbled, ears ringing, but shook it off, his speedster reflexes kicking in. He scanned the field, fists clenched, earth magic crackling around his hands.



Bram (grinning, fierce):

“Hiding, huh? I’ll drag you out!”



Ryfel erupted from the ground a distance away, his eyes sharp with focus. He stomped, earth rumbling as he raised a series of jagged stone walls all over the battlefield, creating a labyrinth of barriers to slow Bram’s speed. 



The crowd gasped, green banners waving high, as the terrain shifted under Ryfel’s command.



Ryfel (calm, calculating):

“Let’s see how you handle this, Bram.”



Bram smirked, his ripped form tensing as he blurred forward, smashing through the first stone wall with a stone-fisted punch, shards flying.



But Ryfel was already moving—he pulled water from the air, shooting it to the floor, freezing it with ice magic to create a slippery patch just beyond the wall. 



Bram skidded on the ice, his speed working against him, and Ryfel tossed a flashbang into the air. The light flared, blinding Bram mid-slide.



Bram (growling, shielding his eyes):

“Comeee ooon! Not again, Ry!”



As Bram regained his footing, Ryfel tunneled under again, emerging on the other side of the field. He raised more stone spikes, this time embedding sticky bombs among them, their surfaces gleaming with adhesive.



Bram charged, breaking through another stone wall with a strengthened punch, but as he passed the spikes, a sticky bomb detonated—[SPLAT!]—coating his legs in thick, glue-like goo. He stumbled, tearing free with his strength, but the delay gave Ryfel time to set a whole lot more traps.



Ryfel (steady):

“Keep breaking them, Bram. I’ve got more.”



Bram grinned, his speed undeterred, and blurred through the next set of traps, smashing them apart with rapid punches. 



But Ryfel had layered a tear gas grenade among the debris—[HISS!]—the gas erupting as Bram broke through, stinging his eyes and throat. Bram coughed, slowing for a moment, but pushed through, his resilience shining as he shattered another stone wall with a roar.



Grandpa Ironfoot (jumping at the stands):

“That’s cheating ya stupid bastard! Fight him like a man!”



Milal (jumping in response):

“Its called tactics, TAC-TICS! You fool! You can’t comprehend the greatness of Young Master!”



Ryfel raised a series of ice walls, their surfaces reflecting the sunlight with light magic, creating disorienting glares to throw off Bram’s depth perception. Bram dashed forward, squinting through the light, and smashed through the first ice wall, shards scattering like glass. 



But Ryfel had hidden a sonic mine behind it—[BOOM!]—the blast rocking Bram, sending him skidding back.



Bram (panting, grinning through the pain):

“Damn, Ry… you’re relentless!”



The crowd murmured, tension rippling through the stands. Ryfel’s traps were endless—each wall, each spike, each patch of ice laced with danger. Bram’s speed let him break through, but he was falling for more traps as he went, his movements growing sluggish from the constant barrage.



Ryfel tunneled under again, emerging near the center of the field. He raised a final set of stone pillars, taller and thicker, and coated them with ice, their surfaces shimmering with light magic. 



Bram charged, smashing through one pillar, then another, but as he broke the third, a sticky bomb exploded—[SPLAT!]—gumming up his arms this time. 



A flashbang followed, blinding him, and a tear gas grenade hissed, filling the air with stinging mist. Bram roared, tearing free of the goo, but his speed was faltering, his breath ragged.



Bram (roaring, fierce):

“I’m done with your tricks, Ry! I’ll break it all!”



Bram’s eyes narrowed, his ripped form tensing as he clenched his fists, fire magic crackling around his strengthened limbs. He let out one loud primal roar, his breath steaming as he stomped hard into the ground with both feet. Suddenly, he blurred into motion.



Moving at speeds so fast the crowd couldn’t follow, a streak of raw power tearing across the battlefield like a storm.



Bram (blurred):

“Let’s see if you can see me now!”



He dashed through the field like a whirlwind, smashing every stone pillar, ice wall, and trap in his path. Stone shards flew, ice shattered, and sticky bombs detonated uselessly in his wake—[SPLAT! BOOM!]—as he obliterated everything Ryfel had built. 



The crowd gasped, unable to track his movements, his speed a blur of destruction that left the battlefield in ruins.



Ryfel stood in the center, his eyes wide, a rare flicker of awe on his face.



Ryfel (impressed, steady):

“Wow, that is incredible, Bram… you’re a true force of nature.”



But Ryfel’s mind was already working. Bram’s speed was generating intense heat, the friction of his movements scorching the ground, sand kicking up in his wake. 



Ryfel seized the opportunity—he clapped his hands, fire magic surging as he added flames to the swirling sand. The heat fused the sand into glass, and the flames roared higher, forming a massive cage of fire and glass around Bram.



A dome of mirrors was created that reflected light in dizzying patterns. The fire crackled at the edges, trapping Bram inside, while the glass created illusions, Ryfel’s form appearing to multiply, a simpler version of Champion Aurex’s legendary illusion magic.



Bram (panting, looking around):

“What the… mirrors? You sneaky bastard, Ry!”



Bram skidded to a stop, his speed faltering as the heat and reflections threw off his senses. He swung a stone-fisted punch at one of Ryfel’s reflections, but it shattered into glass, the real Ryfel appearing behind him. 



Ryfel fired a grappling hook, snaring Bram’s arm, and yanked him into a remaining stone pillar in the cage. 



Bram crashed through it, glass shards cutting his skin, and Ryfel followed with a sonic mine—[BOOM!]—the blast echoing in the enclosed space, disorienting Bram further.



Ryfel (calm, echoing through the hall):

“Aurex uses illusions to confuse his enemies. Let’s see how you handle a taste of it.”



Bram stumbled, swinging wildly at another reflection, but Ryfel appeared from the side, wind gusting to boost his speed, and drove a hard knee into Bram’s ribs. Bram doubled over, skidding across the glass floor, flames licking at his heels. 



He tried to blur away, but the mirrors threw off his sense of direction—he ran straight into a glass wall, cracking it, and Ryfel was there, tossing a final flashbang.



The light flared, bouncing all over the dome of mirrors, blinding not just Bram, but the crowd completely in a finishing spectacle.

Bram (gasping, voice hoarse):
“Damn it, Ry… Now it's me that can’t… see you…”

Ryfel stepped forward, his form flickering golden and shining like the sun among the reflections. He grabbed Bram by his arm. He pulled Bram up, earth hardening his fist, and delivered a final punch to his jaw.

Bram flew back hard, crashing through the hall of mirrors, the cage shattering around him as he hit the dirt outside, unconscious before he landed.

As light fades and the mirror dome crumbles, the crowd and officials slowly regain their sight.

Tournament Official (half blinded, shouting over the crowd):
“Ah ah ah… Is it ove-?

Ry-Ryf-My dam eyes, I can’t see shit! But Ryfel Redimir—The Winner of the Contender Finals!

He will face Champion Aurex for the title!”

The crowd erupted, green banners waving high, their cheers shaking the arena. Ryfel stood in the center of the broken cage, his silhouette framed by the fading light and flames, a finalist ready for the ultimate champion.
