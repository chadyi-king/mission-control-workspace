Chapter 1: A World United



The Embark Pt. 1



Reporter (professional):



“We now turn to the highlights of the speech from the Vice President of the United States of America at the UN Global Summit. Marcus Seneca, titled the Golden Boy, is the youngest Vice President in American history at age 39, adored by many in his country for his excellence during his time with the Navy SEALs. Today, he makes his first formal address to the UN on the Global Plan for the Unification of all countries.”



Vice President Marcus Seneca (calm):



“Good evening, my fellow friends all over the world. I would like to start off by thanking you for trusting both my dear friend and leader, President Don John Treagan, and I with this responsibility to bear. A heavy burden—as though we are Atlas carrying the weight of the world on our shoulders.”



But we hope that in these six years, we have shown you our ability and sincerity through our leadership of this intergalactic vision that we are all gathered here today to witness.



Today marks the beginning of the unification of all countries, as we embark on this universal journey into our first-ever intergalactic cosmic voyage.



We have completed the transformation of our physical Earth into a global spaceship that can travel through the stars! The Planetarium is finally ready!”



As you have chosen us to lead through our years and achievements from the development of Terra Space Force, the President and I will bring us all into planetary wanderlust among the stars and beyond. This, I promise you.”



A rounding applause fills the hall as all the nation's representatives rise to their feet in support of the Vice President as he closes his speech.





Reporter (excited):

“There you have it, folks! A world being united by our collective desire to travel into the stars! Led by our wonderful duo, President Treagan and Vice President Seneca.”



Taking a look at how all of this came about, it was the combined vision of President Treagan and VP Seneca to unite countries together in order to embark on this journey. Nicknamed the Golden Boy among his fans, especially the female ones, due to a rating that became a viral meme where he scored a near-perfect 99.5 percent in accordance to the Golden Ratio of Beauty Phi, his golden blond hair, and his incredible story of his rise to political office…”







Politics Never Ends

Marcus entered the presidential suite, thanking the Secret Service before closing the door behind him.



‘Clack… Beep.’



“Room secured.”



Across the room, Sofi sat at the meeting table, watching the speech replay on the screen.



Sofi (teasing):

“A beautiful speech, but wow, what a puffed-out history of you, huh, Marcus? The youngest Vice President at age 39? Pfft, I’m younger than you, and I became House Speaker!”



She laughed, shaking her head.



Marcus (formal):

“Good morning, Madam Speaker. Thank you for meeting me this afternoon for the briefing on the current unification events.”



Sofi (playful):

“Pfft, no one is around. You can cut the formal act.”



Marcus (grinning):

“Heh! Fineee, but I’ve gotten way better at it though! Look at how stoic and serious I look for the press!”



His face widened into a joyful smile, breaking the composed image he had on stage.







Sofi (mocking):

“Haha! If only they knew how much of a man-child you are behind the scenes! Half of your term in office has been spent watching cartoons and anime instead of political briefs. 



Leaving me to catch you up to speed on everything!”



She smirked, tucking her hair behind her ear.



Marcus:

“Aw, c’mon, Sof! Don’t be like that. Today’s an important day for all of us! Especially Don! It’s so freaking cool that we’re actually uniting the world to travel into space together! The Planetarium is ridiculously awesome!”



His eyes sparkled with excitement.



Sofi:

“Hehe, look at you, all cute like a child with a new toy. Always gets me.”



Her expression softened before snapping back to focus.



Sofi (serious):

“Anyways, I need your serious side for now. We have some major issues to discuss. As the President is focused on bringing us ahead, we were tasked with bringing the rest of the countries under our control.”



Marcus (focused):

“Understood. Please begin the briefing.”



His demeanor shifted instantly—playfulness fading as he switched into work mode.



Sofi (informative):

“East Timor and Laos are the only two nations left that have not agreed to the terms of unification.



They still think they have leverage due to their rich amethyst mineral fields, which are needed for the spacecraft and stations. These are the only two countries that are left affected by the Tariffs.”



Marcus (direct):

“Let’s jump straight to their demands.”







Sofi (exasperated):

“They are demanding a higher position among the Space Nations because of their contribution of materials and engineering know-how.”



She sighed, rubbing her temples.



Sofi (frustrated):

“It looks like you have to balance not only the other Great Four Superpowers but also these smaller countries if you want them all to unite.”



Marcus (thoughtful):

“Well, you know my philosophy, Madam Speaker. I always look for a win-win scenario. World positions are mostly about the optics of their country to all other countries.



What does each country want specifically?”



Sofi (detailed):

“For East Timor, their president is up for re-election soon. As the last few countries jumping onto this global bandwagon, the optics are not kind for him, especially with a majority of his supporters in favor of unification.”



Marcus leaned back, tapping his fingers on the table.



Marcus (strategizing):

“Alright… here’s my plan.”



His thoughts formalized, the gears in his mind clicking into place.



Marcus (confident):

“His root need is simple—win re-election. To do that, he wants his standing among his nation’s opposition to be unanimous. 



I’ll meet with him and propose a visit to his country. We’ll work hand-in-hand for the press, giving him a positive spin among his supporters. 



It will show his people that he is the only candidate who has supported our global vision. In return, once he is back in power, he will ensure that the materials are fairly traded with us for The Planetarium’s further development. We can work out the details after this.”



His eyes sharpened.





Marcus (curious):

“What about Laos?”



Sofi (grim):

“That… is a little more tricky.”



She slid a file across the table.



Sofi (tense):

“Laos has just recently found an entirely new amethyst mineral field, making them the single largest country of raw amethyst minerals that can supply not only The Planetarium but also a full global market.”



She leaned in.



Sofi (urgent):

“They want to be positioned inside the top 10 countries that have contributed to The Planetarium. If not, they won’t join nor sell any of their supply to us.”



Marcus furrowed his brows.



Marcus (puzzled):

“A weird decision… If they don’t sell to us, are they trying to create a black market for these minerals?”



His expression darkened.



Marcus (determined):

“We don’t fully know their intentions yet… but this time, a needed reminder of ‘freedom’ may be due. Let’s discuss the details.”







I Can See Everything and More



The sun was sinking fast, turning the room into a red-hot haze as the meeting fizzled out.



Sofi (relieved):

“East Timor’s locked, Laos starts tomorrow—bam, done.”







Marcus (smirking):

“Yup, keep those mercs off our trail. Special Ops will trash ‘em once they ‘secure’ the field and their guns flop. We’ll hit Laos first, easy.”



Sofi (casual):

“Gotcha, Mr. Vice President. Congress is on deck tomorrow. Meeting’s over.”



She stretched big-time, strutting to the window wall, her curvy shape popping against the sunset. Still killer at 35.



“Four damn hours—sun’s gone. This view though, Marcus—I can see everything up here.”



Marcus (teasing):

“Oh, I’ve got a way hotter one lined up.”



He ditched his jacket and tie, sprawling on the bed, staring her down like prey.



Sofi (intrigued):

“Oooh? Spill it, hotshot.”



She kicked off her heels, half-unzipped her dress, and dropped next to him, smirking.



Marcus (playful):

“Time for…”



He leaned in, breath hot on her ear, letting her squirm—then yelled, “CARTOONS!” Busting up as he grabbed the remote.



Sofi (furious):

“YOU FREAKING—”



She whacked his back hard.



Marcus (laughing):

“Hehehe! Gotcha!”



He flipped channels like a nutcase.



Sofi (exasperated):

“GAH! Why am I crazy for this moron? You’re the Vice President—drop the cartoons, I need us time!”



Marcus (excited):

“Whoa—is this Avatar: The Last AirUser? Final ep with Fire Chad Omai? I’ve smashed this like thirty times!”



Sofi (desperate):

“Oh my God, if I wasn’t soaking right now, I’d snap your neck!”



Marcus spun, grinning wicked.



Marcus (teasing):

“Oh? Snap me? You’d never ditch your best bang—unless you’re into that dark weird stuff.”



Sofi (frustrated):

“A WEEK, Marcus! I set this up—presidential suite, bulletproof window, city view, soundproofed! Agents checked it twice, total lockdown. Been wet since the meeting started, and you’re on this cartoon crap?”



He slid closer, voice dropping to a low, gravelly hum that sent shivers down her spine.



Marcus (seductive):

“Who do you think stretched that meeting just for this sunset vibe?”



Sofi (realizing):

“I KNEW IT! Half that plan was old—you dragged it out to screw with me!”



He smirked, inching closer until his lips hovered a whisper from hers, not touching—just letting the heat build.



Marcus (taunting):

“Maybe I wanted you simmering all day… imagining what I’d do when I finally got you alone.”



Her breath hitched. She lunged to kiss him, but he pulled back, grinning, and pressed a single finger to her lips—slowly dragging it down her chin, her throat, stopping just above her chest.



Sofi (pleading):

“Quit playing, Marcus—touch me already.”



He chuckled, dark and low, and grabbed an ice cube from the bedside champagne bucket. He traced it along her collarbone, the cold bite making her gasp as droplets trickled down her skin. His warm lips followed, kissing the icy path, a hot-cold dance that had her squirming.



Marcus (dominant):

“Not yet. You’ve been bossing me around all day—now I’m in charge.”



He pushed her back onto the bed, straddling her hips but keeping his weight off—just enough to pin her with his presence.



His hands slid under her dress, peeling it down inch by inch, exposing her skin to the cool air. He stopped at her thighs, fingers brushing the sensitive insides, then retreating—teasing her with almost-touches.



Sofi (needy):

“You’re evil… I hate you…”



Her voice cracked, needy, as she reached for him. He caught her wrists, pinning them above her head with one hand, while the other tugged her hair gently, tilting her head back. 



He kissed her neck—soft at first, then a sharp nip, sucking just hard enough to leave a faint mark. She moaned, arching up, but he pressed her down with a low growl.



Marcus (smirking):

“Hate me all you want, babe. You’re still begging for it.”



He released her wrists, only to grab a silk tie from his discarded jacket. He looped it around her hands, tying them loosely to the headboard—not tight, just enough to make her feel the restraint.



Then he leaned back, smirking, and unbuttoned his shirt one agonizing button at a time, letting her watch every flex of his chest.



Sofi (desperate):

“Marcus—please—untie me, I need to touch you—”



He ignored her plea, instead dipping down to kiss her stomach, his stubble scraping as he worked lower, pausing at the edge of her underwear. He exhaled hot breath through the fabric, making her hips buck, then pulled back to blow a cool stream of air—driving her wild with the contrast.



Marcus (teasing):

“Patience, Sofi. Good things come when I say so.”

He slid a hand under her, lifting her hips, and peeled the dress off completely, tossing it aside.



Then he grabbed her ankle, kissing it softly, working his way up her calf with slow, deliberate licks and bites—stopping just short of her thigh. She writhed, the tie tugging as she strained against it.



Sofi (begging):

“You’re killing me—do it already!”



He grinned, climbing back up to hover over her, his bare chest brushing hers—just enough contact to tease, not satisfy. He kissed her jaw, then her earlobe, whispering filthy promises about what he’d do next, his voice a low rumble that vibrated through her. Finally, he untied her hands, and she lunged at him, nails digging into his back.







Sunset Sexytime

Their lips smashed, tongues going hard like a fight. Marcus ripped his shirt open one-handed, the other popping her bra and yanking her dress off. Clothes hit the floor, their sweaty, ripped bodies glued together.



Sofi (gasping):

“Ah hah… need air!”



She gasped, and Marcus dove for her chest, sucking her nipple rough while his fingers worked her clit fast.



Sofi (overwhelmed):

“Oh—oh crap, that trifecta’s unreal!”



He smirked, slipping off his purple ring.



“Bonus round, babe.”



His thumb slid into her rim, slow and filthy.





Sofi (screaming):

“AH! YES—FORGOT THAT—OH HELL!”



She screamed, nails ripping into his back.



“Soaked since the meeting—stick it in now!”



Marcus (grinning):

“Your wish…”



He grabbed his cock, aiming.



Marcus (thrusting):

“…is my command!”



He slammed in, and she arched with a shaky, “AHHHhhhhh… freaking amazing!” He grabbed her boobs, tongue and hands all over, thumb still in her ass, pounding like a beast.



Sofi (frantic):

“Oh shit—I’m dying! It’s everywhere—faster, I’m begging!”



Marcus went nuts—squeezing, sucking, ramming, shaking all four spots ‘til she was wrecked.



Sofi (climaxing):

“I. HAVEN’T. BEEN. THIS. STIRRED. UP. IN. FOREVER! Gonna cum—NOW!”



Marcus (intense):

“Me too, Sof—hit it!”



He crushed her tight, speed cranked.



Sofi (ecstatic):

“Together—YES!”



She chomped his chest, yelling, “I’m cumming—AHHHH—for you!”



Marcus (releasing):

“AGHH—Sof!”



They latched on, shaking through the climax, then flopped, dripping and trashed.



Sofi (panting):

“Huff… your finger’s still in me?”



Marcus (mischievous):

“Yup—round two’s on!”



He wiggled it, grinning dirty.



Sofi (shocked):

“Ooh—stop! I just—oh damn!”



He scooped her up—one hand under, the other still teasing—and slammed her ass against the window.



Marcus (seductive):

“Red as this sunset—kiss me, sexy.”



She blushed hardcore, but their lips crashed, wet and wild. He slid his cock back in, pinning her to the squeaky glass.



Sofi (struggling):

“Can’t—reach the floor!”



Marcus (dominant):

“Don’t need to.”



He pounded deep, and she bit his shoulder.



“Flip me—wanna see that sunset!”



He spun her, smashing her chest-first into the glass, boobs squashing flat as he rammed in from behind, fingers hitting her clit hard.



Sofi (awed):

“Oh—freaking—majestic!”



Her body bounced, sweat streaking the glass in hot, sloppy smears.



Marcus (realizing):

“Now I get your ‘everything and more’ bit!”



He sped up, and she shoved her ass back, matching him.



Sofi (desperate):

“Faster—wreck me!”



He flipped her sideways, one leg over his arm, slamming her into the glass—sweat painting wild streaks.



Marcus (close):

“Damn, Sof—gonna cum again!”



He twisted her back, lifting her high, legs dangling as he drilled her against the window, sweat pouring off in steamy trails.



Sofi (pleading):

“Do it—NOW!”



The glass shook—bulletproof or bust—as he slammed harder.



Marcus (climaxing):

“AGHH!”



He yanked out, blasting all over her back and the glass, cum mixing with her sweat stains.



Sofi (demanding):

“Turn me—wanna see it!”



He spun her one last time, pressing her full-on against the window—sideways, chest-first, ass-out—her body sliding down slow, leaving a dripping, sweaty mural of every angle they’d smashed.



Sofi (buzzing):

“More please, please, please—I’m still buzzing!”



Marcus grinned, flipping her upside-down, her legs hooked on his shoulders, face near his cock as he pinned her head-first against the glass. He shoved in deep straight down her throat, her sweat smearing a new, upside-down streak across the window.



Sofi (muffled):

“Oh—crap—YES! Eat me too!”



He leaned in, tonguing her clit while thrusting, her muffled moans vibrating against his cock.



Marcus (overwhelmed):

“Freaking hell—gonna blow again!”



Sofi (climaxing):

“Same—DO IT!”



Her hands clawed the glass, nails scraping as she screamed, “AHHHH—I’m cumming!”



Marcus (releasing):

“AGHH—Sof!”



He pulled out, shooting across her chest and the glass, her upside-down sweat-stain glowing as they shuddered through it.



Sofi (exhausted):

“Hold on…. Wait wait wait…”



He flipped her back upright, hoisting her high, legs spread wide as he slammed her ass-first into the glass again, going full throttle. Her sweat streaked downward now, a fresh, splayed-out smear joining the chaos.



Sofi (stunned):

“Oh—God—Again??? I’m done for!”



Marcus (determined):

“Yes, one last one—here it comes!”



He rammed her so hard the glass groaned, her boobs bouncing, sweat flying everywhere.



Sofi (screaming):

“AHHHH—cumming again!”



Marcus (finishing):

“AGHH—me too!”



He pulled out, unloading all over her thighs and the glass, her final sweat-stain locking into the mural—a sweaty, dripping mess of every position they’d burned through—sideways, upside-down, spread wide.



They collapsed against it, panting, cum and sweat pooling under them. The sun’s last red blast hit the window, lighting up Sofi’s multiple sweat-streaked silhouette—arms flung out, legs splayed, curves etched in a wild, steamy collage canvas of their chaos.



Marcus (awed):

“Holy crap—look at that mess. You’re a filthy freaking goddess.”



Sofi (teasing):

“You’re a damn beast—ow, I’m wrecked tomorrow.”



She rubbed herself, grinning.



“Snap that window—our secret album needs this bad!”



Marcus hauled her to the bed, both gasping, taking Sofi’s phone to take a few pictures.



Marcus (laughing):

“That secret album no one—not even the prez—gets a peek at! Hahaha!”



Sofi (playful):

“Just us, freak!”



She poked his nose, crashing fast.



“I’m toast.”



Marcus (exhausted):

“Same.”



After a breather, they threw clothes on.



Marcus (cheeky):

“Off to Don—later, Madam Speaker!”



He flicked her nipple and bolted.



Sofi (annoyed):

“Ow! Zip it— Remember! VP and Speaker banging must be classified!”



Marcus (winking):

“No kidding.”



He winked, slamming the door.





The Embark Pt. 2

Marcus (striding):
 “Good morning.”

He moved through the White House halls with purpose, nodding to Secret Service agents as he passed.

Agent (nodding):
 “Good morning, Mr. Vice President.”

Marcus returned the gesture and stepped into the Oval Office.

Behind the Resolute Desk, President Don John Treagan spun a purple ring between his fingers, his face unreadable—deep in thought.

As the door shut, Don pressed a button beneath the desk.
A soft click echoed.

Outside, agents and personnel cleared out instantly.
The doors locked.

Marcus smirked.
He already knew.

He approached the desk and extended his fist.
Don cracked a grin and met the gesture.
Fist bump.

Don Treagan (erupting with laughter):
 “Wahahaha! The day has finally come, Marcus! The day we finally unite the world under our banner! One hell of a fucking day this is! We finally fucking did it!”

He leaned back in his chair, spinning with excitement.

Marcus (grinning, slamming his hands on the desk):
 “Hell yes!”

His eyes burned with energy.

Marcus:
 “I can't believe it, Don. Years of military politics and sowing our vision—we are actually going to bring about world peace. They said it was an impossible promise, but we fucking did it.”

Don Treagan (grinning, leaning forward):
 “It isn't just about peace, Marcus.

We are reshaping our entire planet into a vehicle that can travel through space! We are the literal founders of the Space Age!”

His eyes gleamed with childlike wonder.

Don Treagan:
 “I dreamt of this since I was freaking nine years old, making only a million dollars!”

Marcus (chuckling, shaking his head):
 “When I started working on your political campaign after my Navy SEAL service, I knew you were bound for greatness. Especially after you actually managed to bring on the famous Celon Dusk.”

He leaned in.

Marcus:
 “Our dream from then on was a reality.”

His voice lowered, sharper now.

Marcus:
 “And oh shit—the best news of all. I can't believe it’s actually true! With your announcement later today, everything is going to change.”

Don Treagan (tone shifting slightly):
 “I know! I couldn’t believe it either!”

He paused, breathing slowly.

Don Treagan:
 “But okay, okay… let’s not get ahead of ourselves. I still have the commemoration of The Planetarium today, and you need to finalize those last two countries.”

Marcus (smirking):
 “Alright. The Speaker and I made plans for it yesterday. It was... quite tiring.”

Don Treagan (grinning knowingly):
 “Ohoho. That’s good to hear—you always have my full trust, after all.”

Then, his expression shifted—enough to make Marcus pause.

Don Treagan:
 “Nevertheless, I am going to prepare for my speech. But before you go—”

His eyes flicked to Marcus’s hand.

Don Treagan:
 “Your promise ring. Do you still have it?”

Marcus blinked, instinctively touching the purple ring.
His smirk faltered.

Marcus:
 “Oh? Yeah, man, Don. I always keep it close to me ever since we made that promise to unite the world together as partners. Don't worry about it. I will never forget our promise.”

Don Treagan (exhaling slowly):
 “Good.”

His grin returned, but the weight lingered in his voice.

Don Treagan:
 “You know that's why I love you, man—platonically, of course. You have never let me down, and I intend to do the same.”

Marcus (nodding, smirk back in place):
 “Yes, boss! See ya soon.”

He exited, the door clicking shut behind him.

Don sat in silence, fingers spinning the ring again.

Don Treagan (muttering):
 “At least I know you’ll be safe, Marcus… I really hope it doesn't go bad later.”



The Speech

The UN Hall was packed, every seat filled with representatives from every nation.
 Journalists lined the walls, cameras broadcasting the event live across the world.

As the American delegation entered, the room erupted into applause.

Sofi (walking ahead, taking the podium):
 “Our wonderful friends from around the world, may we present the President of the United States of America and our Grand Chancellor of the Terra Space Force—Don John Treagan!”

The hall thundered with applause.
All delegates rose to their feet, clapping as Don made his way to the center podium.
Scenes of cheering citizens flashed across screens from different countries.

Don smiled, placing his hands on the podium.
Then his voice boomed through the speakers.

Don Treagan:
 “My fellow citizens of our beautiful planet. This is a historic day. 

A day that will be marked as the Day of Global Unification, all because we are united toward one goal—to reach the stars and beyond together as one human race!”

The crowd erupted again.

Don Treagan:
 “With your trust, we have built a world without wars, a world without borders, a world united by one vision.
 
And as you all know about our plans for The Planetarium, we have one more announcement that will change everything.”

A hush fell over the hall.
The tension in the air was palpable.

Don Treagan:
 “Today, I am revealing this to the world.
 I can confirm that we have finally found extraterrestrial life in our galaxies and beyond.”

The room gasped.
 A ripple of shock coursed through the hall, spreading like wildfire.
 Delegates turned to each other, whispering, stunned.

“Is this real?”
 “Aliens exist?”
 “We are not the only life forms?”

The room erupted into chaos.
 And Marcus, standing beside Sofi, grinned widely.

Marcus (thinking):
 “And they call me a hidden man-child? Who wouldn’t be freaking excited hearing this??? Aliens are fucking real!”

He chuckled, watching the media frenzy unfold.



The Assassin in the Shadows

High above the chaos of the UN hall, in an unguarded section of the rafters, a green flame ignited on the floor.

The fire twisted and swirled, unnatural and silent, before two dark, slender hands reached through, pressing against the ground.

A figure emerged, slowly rising from the green inferno.

She stepped forward, her body covered in flickering emerald flames, though they never consumed her skin-tight suit.

The material seemed to shimmer and shift, adapting to the light around her—a living shadow, concealed in plain sight.

Her fingers twitched, and the flames surrounding her shifted.

A sniper rifle materialized, forming piece by piece from the fire—sleek, deadly, and eerily silent.

Two bullets hovered beside her, pulsing faintly with the same ethereal green glow.
She caught one between her fingers, rolling it lazily before sliding it into the chamber.

??? (softly, amused):
 “Hmmm… looks like this is all I can conjure up in this place. Two should be enough.”

Her voice was soft, almost amused, but there was a sharpness beneath it—a cold, calculated confidence.

She moved swiftly, making her way across the beams, finding the perfect vantage point above the podium.

Below, the hall was chaos—delegates arguing, journalists scrambling for information, security struggling to maintain order.

And in the center of it all, Don John Treagan stood tall, basking in the global attention.
A perfect target.

The assassin laid down into position, adjusting the rifle against her shoulder.
She peered through the scope, lining up her shot.

Her green flames dimmed, simmering low so they wouldn’t give away her position.

The crosshairs locked onto the President’s head.

She took a slow breath.

One shot.

That was all it would take.

Her finger hovered over the trigger.

Down below, Marcus scanned the room.

The energy was shifting, the tension morphing into something else.

A familiar feeling crawled up his spine—something was wrong.

His instincts, honed from years in the field, screamed at him.

The hall was too chaotic. Too loud.

And chaos was always the perfect cover for disaster.

Marcus’s eyes flicked across the room, watching, analyzing.

A sudden glint of green light caught the corner of his vision.

It disappeared just as quickly.

His muscles tensed.

He turned his head upward, focusing on the high beams of the hall.

There.

A figure. A gun barrel.

A sniper.

Marcus’s heart slammed in his chest.

No hesitation. No second-guessing.

He knew exactly what was about to happen.

And he only had seconds to stop it.

His body moved before his mind could think.

He lunged forward, sprinting toward the President.

His voice roared over the chaos.

Marcus:
"DON! GET DOWN—RIGH—"!



The shot rang out.

Time seemed to warp and twist as the bullet tore through the air—a streak of green fire, moving faster than thought itself.

A deafening crack split through the hall.

Then—impact.

The ballistic enclosure  exploded, the reinforced shield shattering like glass  as the green flames detonated on contact.

A shockwave rippled outward, sending people stumbling, falling—screaming. Don flew back from the exploded glass seemingly unharmed with a soft purple glow around him.

However, others were not so lucky. The force slammed into Marcus, launching him backward like a ragdoll.

Air left his lungs.

He barely registered the moment his back crashed into a table, the wood splintering beneath him.

Pain flared up his spine, his vision flickering between black and white flashes.

For a second—just one—all he could hear was static.

Then—

Chaos erupted.

Screams. Shouts. Footsteps pounding against the floor.

The hall erupted into mayhem as people trampled over each other, desperate to escape.

The Secret Service agents around the Heads of State had been completely knocked out from the explosion, their bodies motionless on the floor.

Some were groaning, barely conscious. Others weren’t moving at all.

The sprinklers activated, raining down over the burning wreckage, trying to snuff out the eerie green smoke quivering in the air.

Sofi shielded her face, coughing as she forced her way through the panicked crowd.

On stage, Don John Treagan was still down.

He had been blown backward, now slumped weakly against the padded wall behind the ruined podium.

His chest rose and fell unevenly. He was still breathing. Barely.

Marcus’s vision spun as he forced himself to move.

His ribs screamed in protest. His head was still ringing.

But none of that mattered.

His instincts screamed at him—this wasn’t over.

His head snapped upward.

Through the thickening smoke, he could just barely make out—

A silhouette. A rifle. A second shot about to be fired.

His blood ran cold.

Marcus:
"Fuck—"

He pushed off the shattered table, his feet pounding against the floor as he sprinted forward.

He barely processed, as Don was stirring slightly, groaning, still trying to recover from the impact.

Marcus:
"Don! GET DOWN!"

His voice cut through the chaos, but it was already too late.

The second shot was coming.

Marcus’s heart slammed against his ribs as he reached the steps of the podium—

His body moving before his mind could think.

One last push.

One last chance.

He leapt.



CRACK.

The second shot ripped through the air, splitting the echoes of panic.

Marcus had already prepared for the worst.

His body moved on instinct, his training engrained into every fiber of his being—

But this time, there was no time to counter, no time to push Don away, no time for anything but one last decision.

Time slowed.

Marcus was mid-air, his body suspended between action and fate.

His right foot barely touched the ground.

The bullet was coming.

He couldn’t stop it.

But he could intercept it.

Every muscle in his body tightened, his adrenaline spiking beyond reason.

Marcus (Thinking): 
"No time to push him out of the way."

The sniper’s aim was dead-on.

A perfect kill shot.

If he moved an inch differently, Don John Treagan was dead.

Marcus adjusted mid-air, his body twisting—not toward Don, but in front of him.

A human shield.

And then—

Impact.



The Disembark

CRACK.

The sniper round lodged itself deep into Marcus’s right temple.

A shockwave of searing pain rippled through his skull—but only for a moment.

Then—nothing.

No pain. No sensation. Just… silence.

His body jerked violently, the force of the impact slamming him into Don.

SLAM!

Both men collapsed onto the ground, the momentum sending them sprawling across the ruined stage.

The purple barrier—a strange energy field that had briefly flickered to life around them—disappeared.

For a moment, the world was still.

The screaming. The chaos. The gunfire. It all faded.



"Marcus? Oh fuck—MARCUS!"

Don scrambled up, his hands gripping Marcus’s shoulders, his face a mask of pure terror.

Don Treagan:
"Oh fuck, Marcus, are you alive?!"

Footsteps pounded toward them.

Sofi.

She skidded to a stop, her breath hitching as she saw Marcus motionless on the ground.

Her heart clenched.

Sofi:
"MARCUS! PLEASE GET UP!"

She dropped to her knees, grabbing his face, her fingers trembling.

Sofi:
"MARCUS, GET UP! PLEASE! You have to make it—our promise together! I cannot do it without you, you can't leave me!"

Don’s chest heaved, his hands gripping Marcus’s arm so tightly his knuckles turned white.

Marcus’s eyes flickered.

A weak gasp escaped his lips.

Slowly—he moved.

"I… I’m alive?"

Both Don and Sofi froze.

Their eyes widened as Marcus shifted, his body trembling as he slowly sat up.

Don Treagan:
"Wha—"!

Sofi’s breath caught in her throat.

Sofi:
"How?!"

Marcus touched his temple.

His fingers brushed against the bullet—still embedded in his skull.

It should’ve been fatal.

But he was still here.

Breathing.

Alive.

His eyes flickered between them, a haze of shock and confusion settling in.

Marcus:
"I felt it… I felt it hit me. But I’m still—"

Then—

The burning began.

A spark of green light ignited from the bullet wound.

Then another.

Then—fire.

Marcus’s entire body ignited in emerald flames, consuming him from head to toe.

The pain hit like a tsunami.

He screamed.

Marcus:
"AAAHHHHUUGGHHHHHHHH!"

His skin crackled, the fire spreading rapidly, burning too fast—too aggressively.

Sofi’s eyes widened in horror.

Sofi:
"NO! MARCUS!"

Her hands flew to her mouth as she watched in helpless terror.

Don Treagan:
"WHAT THE HELL IS HAPPENING?!"

The flames weren’t normal.

They weren’t burning anything else—just Marcus.

He staggered backward, his feet stumbling across the stage, his hands clawing at his body as if trying to rip the fire away.

But it wouldn’t stop.

Marcus gasped for air.

His lungs turned to fire.

His veins glowed, his flesh blackening, crumbling—

His nerves were searing away faster than they could register pain.

Residing his fate, in his last breath, he muttered to his best friend and lover.

Marcus:
"I'm glad I could at least save you bo…"

His throat burned away, the world falling silent.

His eyes boiled in their sockets.

The last thing he saw was their faces—Don and Sofi, horrified, helpless, reaching for him.

His vision faded to black.



The flames died abruptly.

Marcus was gone.

Nothing but a pile of blackened remains remained where he once stood.

The sprinklers above rained down, clearing the smoke and fire, only to reveal…

Marcus’s burnt body with a small tuft of golden hair lay untouched to his crisp blackened skull, a single piece of him in contrast to the charred body beneath it.

Sofi collapsed to her knees.

Her hands trembled over her lips, unable to speak.

Don stared.

His hands balled into fists, his jaw clenched, his chest rising and falling with ragged breaths.

His best friend. His brother.

Gone.

And there was nothing he could do.



Up in the rafters, the sniper lowered her rifle.

She had stayed long enough to confirm the kill.

Her eyes narrowed.

Her lips curled slightly— not into a smirk, but a scowl.

???:
"Shit… I killed the wrong guy."

She exhaled, tapping her fingers against the barrel.

???:
"Let’s hope it’s not a wasted effort. Maybe something will come of this… though I doubt it."

She glanced at the horrified figures below, then sighed.

Lifting her boot, she pressed it into the ground—

A green flame erupted beneath her feet.

Her body sank into it, vanishing into the fire.

The flames snuffed out instantly, leaving nothing behind.

The assassin was gone.

And down below—

The world had just lost one of its greatest men.
