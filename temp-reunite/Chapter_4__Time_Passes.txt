Chapter 4: Time Passes



The soft glow of morning light seeped through the wooden creaks of the window, casting a golden hue across Ryfel’s room.

As the first ray of sun touched his face, his eyes flickered open instantly—no grogginess, no hesitation.

With a slight motion of his hand, the light bent slightly upward, redirecting away from his face.

Ryfel (thought):
"Too early for that, Sun. Let me wake up properly first."

He inhaled deeply, filling his small but stronger lungs with the crisp morning air. His body—though still that of a five-year-old, felt significantly more developed than a normal child’s.

Five years of consistent training had shaped his form.

But more importantly, no one suspected a thing.



The Morning Routine of a Hidden Prodigy

Without hesitation, Ryfel rolled off his bed, using earth magic to soften the landing.

His feet touched the floor, but with a tap of his toe, he reinforced it back to solid clay, as if he had never moved anything at all.

Ryfel:
"First: warm-up."

He transitioned seamlessly into slow Tai Chi movements, his small frame shifting fluidly as he circulated the air and earth around him.

Ryfel:
"Flexibility, balance, breath control—keep it natural, keep it subtle."

His fingers curled slightly, feeling the faint energy of mana flowing beneath his skin.

Ryfel (pondering):
"My feel and flow of mana are much better than before… but I still have to be careful."

After a few more movements, he pushed small bursts of air from his feet, propelling himself lightly forward, circling his room in mini laps.

It was training.
But to anyone watching, it was just a child playing.



With his body warmed up, Ryfel waved his hand, drawing water from his drinking container with practiced ease.

He let it hover just for a second—then pulled it into his mouth for a drink while simultaneously guiding a small stream to cleanse his face.

Satisfied, he walked toward the bookshelf, tapping his foot against the floor. A tiny pulse of earth magic lifted him up just enough to reach the shelf effortlessly.

His fingers danced over the spines of the books, quickly finding his place from last night’s study session.

The 12th book from the left.

He descended smoothly, the soft earth beneath his feet cushioning his landing as he moved toward the desk.

A snap of his fingers—a small controlled spark—lit the lamp beside him, illuminating the pages.

Ryfel:
"Time to review."

For the next thirty minutes, he silently read, absorbing the knowledge as fast as his body would allow.

Language, history, noble structures, magic theory—anything that could be useful for the future.

He turned a page, mentally mapping out the connections between different noble houses.

Ryfel (reading):
"House Redimir is respected, but not feared. We control agriculture, yet we aren’t politically aggressive. The other noble families probably see us as ‘useful but not a threat.’"

His lips twitched slightly.

Ryfel:
"That… is completely horrible but it might be a good thing. For now."

As he continued, soft footsteps echoed from the master bedroom.

His family was waking up.

Ryfel:
"Time’s up."

He shut the book, swiftly placing it back on the shelf before leaping back onto his crib, shifting the earth back to normal.

With expert precision, he pulled his blanket over himself, shutting his eyes.

And just as the door creaked open…

Ryfel let out a small, adorably sleepy yawn.



A Five-Year-Old’s Charm

Elda peeked into the room, sunlight spilling over her as she gently pushed open the door.

Elda:
"Good morning, my little Ry!"

Ryfel, already awake but pretending otherwise, let out a slow groggy sigh, stretching his arms dramatically before blinking up at her.

Ryfel:
"Mmmh… five more minutes…"

Elda gasped, clutching her chest.

Elda:
"Kyaaa! Look at my baby boy growing up so quickly! So cute!"

Ryfel internally sighed but allowed himself to be scooped up effortlessly into her arms.

Ryfel (thinking):
"At this rate, I’m going to suffocate in motherly affection before I turn ten."

She swayed him slightly as they walked toward the master bedroom, where Ryker was sprawled out face-down, still half-asleep.

Elda:
"Good morning, my dear husband! Our little Ry is awake! Say hi to your papa!"

Ryfel yawned exaggeratedly, leaning toward Ryker with a tired voice.

Ryfel:
"Morning, Papa… You look like you lost a battle against the bed."

Ryker grunted into his pillow before rolling over, his hair a mess, eyes still heavy with sleep.

Ryker:
"Mmm… morning, Little Ry…"

Another yawn.

Ryker:
"Y’know… I always prepared myself for sleepless nights before we had a kid… but by the gods, you’re the easiest child ever."

Ryfel smirked slightly but hid it well as he reached toward Ryker, putting on his best innocent face.

Ryfel:
"Papa, do you want me to carry you this morning?"

Elda snorted, covering her mouth, while Ryker cracked open one eye.

Ryker (smirking):
"Oi yoi, I might be tired, but I’m still your father, kid."

He ruffled Ryfel’s hair with one large hand, grinning.

Ryker:
"Ready for another exciting day of being adorable?"

Ryfel grinned back, playing along as usual, but inside, his mind remained sharp.

Morning in the Redimir household was always warm and full of life. The scent of fresh bread and roasted grains drifted in from the kitchen as Milal prepared breakfast, while the hum of early chatter filled the dining room.

Ryfel sat at the table reading, legs swinging slightly, playing the part of a cheerful five-year-old.

Inside his mind?

"It’s time to move to the next phase."

For these five years, he had carefully hidden his intelligence, using simple words, avoiding advanced magic, and never drawing too much attention.

But today, he would begin showing just a fraction of his potential.

Something small. Something that would make them proud, not suspicious.

Ryfel:
"Time to make them notice."

Milal approached, setting a wooden cup filled with clear water in front of him.

Milal:
"Here you go, Young Master. Fresh water from the well this morning!"

Ryfel grinned, reaching for the cup—

And then, with calculated precision, he let it "slip."

The cup tilted mid-air, the water inside spilling out—

Except it didn’t fall.

The liquid hovered perfectly between the cup and the table, as though time itself had paused around it.

Then, with a small, effortless motion, Ryfel guided the water smoothly back into the cup, without spilling a single drop.

For a moment, nobody spoke.

Then—

Elda’s eyes widened in shock.

Milal’s hands trembled, nearly dropping the serving tray.

Ryker… just stared.

Elda:
"Did… Did you just…??"

She turned to look at Ryker, then back at Ryfel, her voice shaking between disbelief and excitement.

Ryker:
"Son, did you just use water magic, be-because I have never seen you use it before?!"

Ryfel tilted his head, blinking innocently.

Ryfel:
"Huh? What do you mean, Father?"

Milal clutched her chest.

Milal:
"Young Master, yo-you just controlled water without learning it? And with—"

She paused, looking between the cup and Ryfel.

Milal:
"—perfect control."

That was when Ryker stood up so fast that his chair nearly toppled over.

Ryker:
"…No. No, that’s not possible."

The air in the room felt different—heavy with disbelief, charged with excitement.

Ryfel sat quietly, keeping his face calm, but his mind was sharp, watching his parents’ every reaction.

Elda and Ryker weren’t just surprised.
They were stunned.

Ryker exhaled sharply, rubbing his chin as he paced. Then, without warning—

Ryker:
"This can’t be right."

He grabbed the cup of water, setting it down on the table.

Ryker:
"Let’s see for ourselves."

He hovered his hand over the cup, his brows furrowing in deep concentration.

The water trembled, responding to his mana—

It shifted slightly but moved in uneven waves, sloshing against the sides of the cup.

A single drop spilled over the rim.

Elda covered her mouth.

Even Ryker, a trained earth and practical magic user, couldn’t control the water as precisely as his five-year-old son.

He stared at the cup, then at his hand, then back at Ryfel.

Ryker:
"This is insane."

His voice was almost breathless.

Then, his gaze snapped to Elda.

Ryker:
"Dear. Try it."

Elda hesitated for only a moment. Unlike Ryker, she had always been gifted in water magic rather than earth.

She rolled back her sleeves, her elegant fingers hovering over the cup.

A soft pulse of mana rippled from her hand, and instantly, the water obeyed.

It rose delicately in the air, forming a small, controlled spiral, spinning effortlessly before settling back into the cup without a single spill.

The difference was clear.

Ryker:
"Hah. I knew it."

He chuckled, shaking his head, looking at his wife in admiration.

Ryker:
"You always were better at this than I."

Elda gave him a knowing smirk, but her eyes never left Ryfel.

Then she gently took his small hands, her touch gentle but firm.

Elda:
"My love… do you even know how you did that?"

Ryfel blinked innocently, tilting his head as if he were thinking hard.

Ryfel:
"Uhm… I just didn’t want to spill it?"

A long silence.

Then—

Ryker laughed, loud and full.

Ryker:
"AHAHAH! Elda, do you hear this?! He’s so damn smart, he doesn’t even realize it!"

Elda, however, was still watching Ryfel closely.

Her mother’s intuition was kicking in.

She knew what natural talent looked like.

And this?

This was far beyond that.

She reached out again, brushing a strand of Ryfel’s hair from his face.

Elda:
"You’re special, my little Ry."

She looked at Ryker, her voice firm.

Elda:
"We start training tomorrow."

Ryker:
"Damn right we do."

And just like that—

The next phase of Ryfel’s life had begun.



A New Routine

Over the next few days, Ryfel's routine had changed. He used to be in the house all the time with Milal taking care of him while Ryker does his daily district work and Elda tends their House farmland.

Now, after his own morning routine, Elda takes charge of education for the morning, Milal teaches magic for house chores and cooking in the afternoon, and Ryker comes home to teach history and magic for farming. On the weekends, instead of play and fun, Ryker takes Ryfel throughout the district to familiarize himself with the locals and area.

Ryfel, now five years old, sat in the center of the room, his small hands resting on his lap. He took a slow breath, letting mana flow naturally through his body, just enough to make it seem like instinct rather than calculation.

"Time to take this next step carefully…"

He placed a palm against the wooden floor and focused.

A low hum vibrated through the ground.

The earth stirred.

Slowly, the floor shifted and molded, forming a miniature replica of Minas-Col—a detailed landscape, carefully crafted with natural elements.

As the land took shape, Ryfel reached out, guiding water into the structure, letting it flow into small rivers and pools.

He narrowed his eyes slightly, controlling the refraction of light through the water, turning the streams into vibrant colors—

Green for the Outer Court,
Blue for the Inner Court,
And a faint red shimmer at the centre—symbolizing the King’s Court.

Finally, with a gentle push of air, he let warm steam rise, creating a misty fog over the city.

Ryfel leaned back, satisfied.

Ryfel:
"Kingdom... Minas-Col."

The room once again fell silent.

Elda’s eyes widened in disbelief.

Milal covered her mouth, staring in shock.

Ryker… blinked twice, then let out a breathless chuckle, eyes still locked on the display before him.

Ryker:
"…That’s not normal."

Elda finally snapped out of her daze, her voice half whisper, half stunned exclamation.

Elda:
"That’s… incredible."

Ryfel tilted his head slightly, pretending not to understand their amazement.

Ryfel:
"Did I do it wrong?"

Elda shook her head immediately.

Elda:
"No, no, my love—you did it perfectly! But… but children your age—even talented ones—can barely form basic shapes, let alone control multiple elements at once!"

Milal, still frozen in shock, slowly approached.

Milal:
"Young Master… do you… feel tired?"

Ryfel thought carefully.

If he answered too confidently, they would be too suspicious.

If he acted too exhausted, they might think something was wrong.

He let out a small, deliberate exhale, rubbing the back of his head.

Ryfel:
"A little bit… but it was fun!"

Ryker let out a low whistle, shaking his head in disbelief.

Ryker:
"Hah! The boy doesn’t even realize how insane this is!"

He turned toward Elda.

Ryker:
"This isn’t just talent, Elda. He’s doing things that mages twice his age struggle with. I’ve seen grown men take years just to control two elements properly, and he’s sitting here like it’s just another day!"

Elda placed a hand over her chest, trying to steady her thoughts.

Elda:
"I knew he was special… but this?"

She turned to Ryfel, her expression soft yet serious.





Later in the evening, Ryker clapped his hands together, grinning.

Ryker:
"Alright then! Let’s put that little mind of yours to the test!"

Milal rushed into the next room, quickly returning with a small wooden tray filled with assorted stones.

She set it in front of Ryfel, giving him a quick thumbs-up.

Milal:
"This is a standard test, Young Master. Every noble child is given a set of raw stones to see how well they can manipulate earth magic."

She gestured toward the stones.

Milal:
"You only need to mold one for now."

Ryfel glanced at the tray.

Granite. Basalt. Sandstone. Marble.

He could shape all of them easily—but showing that would be too much.

Ryfel (Thinking):
"Control your pace, Ryfel. Show them just enough."

He reached forward and picked up the granite.

The room fell silent as he cupped the stone in both hands.

A moment of pause.

Then, the granite began to shift.

Slowly, Ryfel shaped it into a small, smooth cup.

The room held its breath.

Ryfel:
"That should be enough."

But just as he was about to place it down, something inside him stirred.

A faint whisper of mana.

His fingers twitched—

And before he realized it, the water in his previous miniature morning model rose from the structure, flowing toward the cup and settling inside, filling it to the brim.

The moment it happened, Ryfel froze.

Ryfel (thought):
"Shit. I didn’t mean to do that."

The room exploded.

Elda gasped, nearly dropping her tea.

Ryker slammed his hands on the table.

Milal’s tray actually slipped from her fingers.

Ryker:
"Did you see that?! He didn’t just shape the granite—he instinctively pulled the water into it! That—That’s a level of control you can’t just teach!"

Elda, still staring, looked at Ryfel with both pride and concern.

Elda:
"This… this confirms it. We have to be careful, Ryker. We can’t just throw him into training like any other child."

Ryker paused, nodding slowly.

Ryker:
"You’re right. If we don’t guide this properly, he’ll either become unstoppable… or he’ll burn himself out before he even reaches his prime."

Milal, still in shock, suddenly spoke.

Milal:
"Young Master… do you even know how you did that?"

Ryfel, still recovering from his slip-up, quickly shook his head.

Ryfel:
"Uh… no? I just… thought it would be nice if the cup had water in it."

Silence.

Then, Ryker let out a deep, proud laugh.

Ryker:
"AHAHAH! Gods, this kid is gonna change the world and he doesn’t even know it!"

Elda sighed, rubbing her temples.

Elda:
"At this rate, I wouldn’t be surprised if he learns more advanced magic on instinct alone…"

However, Ryker beamed, his excitement barely contained.

Ryker:
"Don’t forget, though, it isn’t just about magic and intelligence. He has to prove himself in so many other areas! Contributions, leadership, inventions—"*

He ran a hand through his hair, letting out a short laugh.

Ryker:
"Hah! I really don’t think we should push it too much. These past few days have been quite tiring for us too."

Elda nodded, her voice softer.

Elda:
"That’s what worries me, Ry. He’s growing so fast… If we push him too hard, we might put expectations on him that no child should bear."

Their conversation faded into the background as Ryfel, sitting quietly, observed them both.

His mother’s cautious love.
His father’s unstoppable ambition.

He understood them both.

But this—this was his moment.

A small smile played at his lips as he glanced down at the assorted stones on the table.

Ryfel (thinking):
"Then let me show them something they can’t ignore."

The First Creation

Without hesitation, Ryfel reached forward, his small fingers grazing over the stones.

He took a deep breath—

And moved.

The granite shifted first, molding into a small, hollow container in his palm.

Then, with a flick of his fingers, he heated the bottom with fire magic, just enough to boil a few drops of water.

The steam rose instantly.

But he wasn’t done.

He guided the steam upward, letting it whirl and dance with the air currents, shaping it into a controlled spiral.

Next—light.

Ryfel adjusted the refraction of light through the mist, bending and scattering it in all directions.

The soft hues of red, blue, and green blended, painting the air in an iridescent glow.

A delicate, shimmering aurora formed above them, dancing against the ceiling.

A silence descended upon the room.



Both Ryker and Elda stopped mid-conversation.

Their words vanished into nothing.

The room’s entire lighting had changed.

A soft, twilight glow bathed everything in mystical, shifting colors.

They turned their heads upward, jaws dropping at the sight before them.

And then—

They looked down.

At Ryfel.

Their five-year-old son, hands moving gracefully, eyes slightly glazed from focus.

He was controlling it all—the steam, the air, the light.

Casually.

Effortlessly.

Like it was the most natural thing in the world.

Ryker and Elda collapsed onto the sofa simultaneously, utterly stunned.

Ryker:
"Elda… tell me I’m not dreaming."

Elda:
"I… I don’t think I’ve ever seen something like this before."

They both looked at each other, then back at Ryfel.

Elda slowly exhaled, nodding.

Elda:
"Okay… I won’t doubt you ever again."

Ryker, still staring at the aurora, muttered in awe.

Ryker:
"Yeah, I don’t think I’ll doubt myself ever again either."

A sudden wet splat broke the silence.

They turned their heads toward Milal, who had been snacking in the background.

Her mouth hung open, a half-chewed piece of bread plopped onto the floor from sheer shock.

Ryfel, still half-dazed from mana use, turned to them with a small, sleepy smile.

Ryfel:
"Auro… Aurora Lights. You seen before?"

His voice was soft, curious.

His entire family shook their heads in unison.

Ryfel grinned.

Ryfel:
"I used all the elements… t- to make dancing lights for you!"

His body swayed slightly, exhaustion finally catching up from moving so much mana in one sitting.

His eyes fluttered shut.

And just as he began to tip sideways, Elda rushed forward, catching him before he plopped onto the floor.

She held him close, brushing his hair gently.

Elda (whispering):
"You, my son… are truly something else."

Ryfel, barely awake, curled into her warmth and let sleep take him.



All Aboard

Elda gently laid a sleeping Ryfel into his crib. His small chest rose and fell in steady breaths, exhaustion overtaking his tiny body after an eventful day.

She brushed a few stray strands of his dark hair with golden-streaked tuft aside and pressed a delicate kiss onto his forehead.

Elda (whispering):
"Sleep well, my little miracle."

She lingered for a moment, simply watching him—this child who had changed everything.

Then, with quiet steps, she made her way back to their bedroom, where Ryker was already sprawled across the bed, arms behind his head, eyes half-lidded in contemplation.

As soon as she slipped under the covers, she sighed, rolling toward him.

Elda:
"Okay, Ry… I have something to say."

He turned his head, raising a brow.

Ryker:
"Hmm?"

She hesitated for a moment, then let out another sigh.

Elda:
"It's been six weeks only. Only six weeks of a drastic change in schedule—late nights, early mornings, pouring everything into training Ryfel. I just… I want to say I’m sorry if I ever seemed like I was doubting you. Or him."

Her voice softened.

Elda:
"I just wanted to make sure we weren’t pushing him too hard."

Ryker chuckled, shifting onto his side to face her, his gaze warm and unwavering.

Ryker:
"Oh, my El-dear, I never thought that at all."

He reached over, brushing his fingers lightly against her cheek.

Ryker:
"You were always the one keeping my feet on the ground. Your caution, your care—that's what makes us strong. I never assumed you were doubting me… or our son. You’ve only ever protected us."

She bit her lip, her fingers curling slightly into the sheets.

Elda:
"Really? I always thought you didn’t like me getting in the way of your excitement and plans."

Ryker laughed, a deep, warm sound, before reaching out to pull her into his chest, pressing a firm kiss onto her forehead.

Ryker:
"My love, you are the perspective I need. The piece of reality that keeps me from getting too reckless. And yet, even I didn’t think Little Ry could create something like that today."

She hummed against him, resting her head against his chest, listening to the rhythmic thrum of his heartbeat.

Elda:
"So… you forgive me?"

Ryker:
"Forgive you? I never even thought you were wrong."

She lifted her head slightly, tilting her gaze up at him, her deep blue eyes glimmering under the soft candlelight.

A slow smirk formed on her lips.

Elda:
"You know… it's the first time in a long time since we ended the day this early."

Ryker raised a brow, recognizing the shift in her tone.

Ryker:

"Mmm?"

He sprawled in a sturdy wooden chair by the hearth, legs stretched out, tunic loose and rumpled from the day. Firelight flickered over his broad shoulders, casting a warm glow across the stone walls. Elda edged closer, her breath soft and warm against his ear, fingers trembling as they brushed his thigh—tentative, slow, barely grazing his breeches.



Elda (whispering, shyly):

"I. Hope. You. Know. What. I’m. Talking. About."



Her words came out halting, unsure, each one paired with a hesitant inch higher, her fingertips light and shaky. She stopped short, hovering, eyes wide as she peeked at him, cheeks already pink.



A rough growl rumbled from Ryker’s throat, low and hungry. His hand slid down her back, settling at the curve above her hips, fingers pressing through her thin shift—just enough to feel her shiver, her breath catching in a tiny gasp.



Ryker (husky, teasing):

"Oh, I know exactly what you’re talking about."



His grin was slow and wicked, but he didn’t rush her. He tugged her gently to stand between his thighs, hands resting on her hips, thumbs brushing under her shift to stroke her skin—soft, warm, quivering under his touch.



Elda:

“You—you do?”



Her voice was small, eyes darting to the floor, then back to him. He fumbled behind her, picking up a smooth earthen wand from the table—polished, Ryker gently quivered it through his mana. He held it out, then pressed it lightly to her neck, rolling it slow. The vibration sank in, and she groaned, head tipping back.



Ryker:

“Starting with this, just. for. You.”



His voice was rough, playful, as he took the wand from her shaky grip.



He dialed it up, the hum sharpening, and traced it down her arm—slow, gentle, watching her skin prickle.



Elda:

“I—I didn’t remember thi—oh, that’s… nice.”



Her words stumbled, a soft squeak slipping out as he slid the wand to her lower back, pressing it where her spine dipped. The buzz tingled through her, and she swayed, hands fluttering to his shoulders, clinging lightly. “Ry, what are you doing?”



Ryker:

“Just warming you up, my dear. You’re trembling already.”



He grinned, pulling her into his lap, slow and careful, her knees settling on either side of him. The wand hummed as he ran it up her side, teasing the edge of her shift, brushing the soft curve beneath her chest. Her breath hitched, eyes wide, a flush creeping down her neck.



Elda:

“Ry—it’s—it’s too much, I—I don’t know what to do!”



Her voice cracked, half a giggle, half a plea, she grabbed the wand back with shaky hands. She pushed at his chest, guiding him deeper into the chair, climbing atop him clumsily—her shift riding up, baring pale thighs. She pressed the wand to his chest, sliding it down his abs, hesitant but curious, watching them tighten.



Ryker:

“Too much? You’re doing fine, El—damn fine.”



His hands found her thighs, sliding under the shift, kneading gently—firm but not rough, feeling her tense then melt. Snatching back the wand, the hum buzzing against his belly button, he turned it back to her, slowly sliding down.



Elda:

“Ry—I—I didn’t think it’d feel like this.”



He spread open her thighs wider. The wand buzzed against her skin, sliding slow and deliberate over the soft mound above her clit—close, so close—its vibration pulsing through the thin shift. Her hips twitched, a tiny whimper slipping out, and he pressed it lower, letting the rounded tip graze the edge of her most sensitive spot, the hum sinking in deep.



Elda:

“Ry—oh—w-what’s that—?”



Her words broke into a gasp, high and shaky, her hands clutching his shoulders, nails biting in as the sensation hit. Her thighs quivered, clamping around him, and her wide eyes locked on his—startled, pleading, a flush blooming from her cheeks down her chest. The wand’s hum thrummed against her clit now, light but relentless, and she squirmed, half-pulling away, half-pressing closer.



Ryker:

“That’s it, El—right there, huh? You like that?”



He smirked, voice thick with heat, holding her steady with one hand on her hip while the other guided the wand—circling slow, teasing the swollen bud, then pressing just a little harder. The vibration rippled through her, wet heat seeping against his fingers as he nudged the shift aside, baring her to the firelight. Her breath came in short, frantic bursts, hips rocking instinctively against the buzzing wood.



Elda:

“I—I don’t—it’s—Ryker, please!”



Her plea was a jumble, innocent panic laced with need, her body trembling as the wand’s hum pushed her higher. She buried her face in his neck, muffling a soft cry, her thighs slick and shaking against his breeches. Her hands clawed at his skin gently but surely, clinging as the sensation overwhelmed her—new, wild, too much and not enough.



Ryker:

“Please what, my dear? Tell me—or I’ll keep going ‘til you can’t talk.”



He growled low, shifting the wand to slide along her clit again—up, down, a slow drag that made her jolt with every pass. His free hand slipped under her shift, cupping her arse, lifting her closer so the vibration hit just right. Her gasps turned to whimpers, her innocence unraveling in the fireglow, and he watched her fall apart, eyes dark with hunger and triumph.



Elda:

“Please Ryyyyy. I can’t wait any more! Please take me…”

Ryker:
"And I also know… that I’ve been waiting way too long for this." 
Flinging away the vibrating wand for a bigger meat-ier wand right between his legs.

Distant into the night, the master bedroom creaks loudly, Ryfel awakes from the noise. He turns to find out what happened.
