Chapter 5: Magical Uses All Around





Ry, Ry, Redimir, Kingdom’s Greatest Love Machine



Their kiss hung in the air, deep and needy, as Ryker and Elda peeled each other bare. Ryker tossed her blouse aside, pulling her in for a harder kiss. One hand teased her sweet spot, the other fumbled her bra loose. 



Elda’s face pressed closer with every jolt his fingers sent through her. She popped his vest and shirt open, yanked his pants off, and their clothes flew everywhere. She hugged him tight, tongues stuck together like they’d never part, and they crashed onto the bed, making it bounce.



Elda:

"Ah… gotta catch my breath, dear!"



She pulled back, panting, flicking her hair into a quick knot. The fireplace light shimmered on her sweaty skin, her round breasts swaying just enough to stop Ryker cold. He stared, drinking in her glowing body like she was some divine beauty pinning him down.



Ryker:

"Wow. You truly are even more beautiful than the day I laid my eyes upon you."

He smiled soft, full of love. Elda smirked down at him, eyes twinkling.



An entranced switch seemingly turns on in Elda.



Elda:

"Those… words are the key for what’s going to happen next."





Her hand slid back, finding his hardening cock under her. Four fingers played with his balls, thumb teasing the tip slow and deliberate. Ryker swallowed hard, melting into it.



Ryker:

"Oh… Elda, my beautif…"



She leaned in, tongue brushing his nipple, her other hand teasing its twin. Ryker grit his teeth, the pleasure hitting him like a wave as she started stroking his shaft, pinky still messing with his balls.



Elda:

"Still gets you, huh, darling?"



Ryker grabbed her asscheeks, squeezing firm.



Elda:

"Mmph!"



She nibbled his chest, and he squeezed harder, slapping his cock between her cheeks. She pushed it deeper, riding him with her ass, and he smacked a hand on her back.



Ryker:

"Can’t take this teasing anymore—it’s time to let me in."



Elda looked up, tongue still on him.

"Oooh no no no. It’s been too long…"



She stumbled over her words, then took a breath.

"I’m going to make you enjoy this one."



She snatched a cloth, tying it over his eyes.



Ryker:

"What’s this dear?"



Her hands roamed his sweaty, farmer-built chest, sliding slow over his tight abs. Her head dipped low, fingers dancing on his nipples again as she sucked one ball into her mouth, gentle and hot.



Ryker:

"Ough! What the hell, Elda—this is amazing!"



He grabbed her head, shaking. Her tongue hit the other ball, teeth grazing light, then wrapped halfway up his shaft, lips puckering tight. She bobbed slow, matching his shaky gasps.



Elda:

"Mmmh…"



Her tongue flicked his tip fast, like a snake striking. Ryker’s legs locked around her waist, jerking her closer. She opened wide, swallowing his cock halfway ‘til it hit her throat, spit dripping from the corners.



Elda:

"Mmmh, it’s always too big!"



Ryker yanked the cloth off, staring down at her sucking him like it was her life’s work.



Ryker:

"It’s a team effort, beloved."



He cupped her breast, pinching her nipple sharp. She sucked harder, taking three-quarters now, throat working overtime.



Ryker:

"Ugh—I’m about to cum, Elda!"



His head rocked back, fingers teasing faster. She went wild, pumping him deep and fast, all the way to her throat.



Ryker:

"AHHHH!"

He thrust up, grabbing her breast hard as cum burst into her mouth, pulsing wild. She sucked it all down, swallowing every bit, not letting a drop escape.



Ryker flopped back, drained, chest heaving. Elda wiped her mouth with her hand, licking the sweat off, then tapped his drooping cock with a finger.



Elda:

"You better be ready for round two… now."



Fireplace Frenzy

Ryker:

"Huff… give me a moment, El-dear!"



Elda grinned, climbing over him, her sweaty body shining in the firelight.

"No chance, Ry—it’s been too long. You’re all mine."

She straddled his hips, grinding slow, stirring him back to life.



Ryker:

"You’re a devil, woman!"

He grabbed her, flipping her onto her back, pinning her down.



Elda:

"Oooh—take me, dear!"

He slammed into her, fierce and quick, the bed creaking loud. Her legs hooked his waist, pulling him in deep.



Elda:

"Yes—yes—harder, Ry!"

Ryker growled, pounding her into the furs, sweat dripping from his face onto her chest.



Ryker:

"Like this?"



She clawed his back, nails digging in.

"Oh—don’t you dare stop!"



He flipped her again, yanking her hips up, slamming in from behind. Her ass bounced with every hit, firelight throwing their shadows wild across the room.



Elda:

"Ah—Ry—I’m so close!"



Ryker:

"Me too—come on, dear!"

He reached around, teasing her spot with his fingers, driving her over the edge.



Elda:

"AHHHH—I’m there!"

She shook hard, tightening around him as she hit her peak.



Ryker:

"AGHH—Elda!"

He pulled out, spilling across her back, his seed mixing with her sweat. They collapsed, panting, tangled in the furs.



Elda:

"Huff… you’re a wild one, my love."



Ryker:

"And you’re my fire—ow, my back’s sore from you."



Magic for Gathering

Ryker:

"Huff… just one minute, dear!"



Elda pouted, sprawled over him, her body slick with sweat in the firelight.

"Nuuuuu, I’m already too wet! Give me your hand and be ready to share your mana rights"



Ryker chuckled, a little nervous.

"Oh yea, forgot about that! Just… don’t go too wild like last time, alright?"



They clasped hands, voices syncing firm.

"I allow the flow."



The air hummed as mana sparked between them. Elda twirled her finger slow around his cock, a faint glow trailing her touch. It rose fast, turning red-hot and rock-hard again. She smirked, bending the water from a nearby basin to swirl around it, cooling him down.



Ryker:

"Oooooh—that’s soothing. Alright, I’m ready!”

Elda pressed her finger hard on his tip, bending it all the way back to his bellybutton with a wicked grin.



Ryker:

"Oh? Rough all the way today, huh?"

She nodded fast, eyes wide and wild like a cat on the hunt. He stroked her hair gentle—then yanked it back hard, arching her whole body into a perfect curve.



Elda:

"Ahhhh YES!"



Ryker shifted quick, kneeling as her legs splayed wide, her soaked core staring him down. He rammed in with a brutal thrust.



Elda:

"OHHH! Yes, that hard!"



He wrapped his arms around her waist, hoisting her ass off the bed, pounding relentless as he knelt upright. SMACK SMACK SMACK—her cheeks clapped against his thighs, echoing loud. Half her body dangled in the air, pressed tight to his pelvis. She clawed the bedsheet loose, breasts bouncing crazy with every hit.



Elda:

"AH AH AH—it’s so HARD, Ry! You’re pounding me silly—I’m losing it!"

She grabbed the mattress itself, nails sinking in. Ryker lifted her higher with his strong arms—THUD—the bed sprang back as she let go. He pulled her into a deep, messy kiss, tongue chasing her uvula while he kept hammering. She clawed his back, their nipples smashing together hard.



Ryker stood slow, hips still driving, carrying her to the fireplace. The heat licked their sweat as he slammed her against the wall, a thrust so deep it hit her cervix.



Elda:

"Oh my goodness!"

Her eyes rolled back, pleasure shocking through her. He kept ramming, the wall shaking with every thump. With both hands, he molded the earth into crude handles, gripping tight and jackhammering faster. Elda’s fluids gushed out, legs wrapping him tight to take it all.



Elda:

"FASTER RY—FASTER—I’M GONNA CUM!"

Her nails dug deeper into his back.



Ryker:

"Ahhh—that stings, but it’s making me wilder!"

She locked eyes with him, her signal, but he stopped dead.



Elda:

"WHAT—WHY?!"



Ryker grinned, devious.

"Not without the back door, my love."



Elda squirmed, helpless and hot.

"…mmmmm Ok fineee."



A Backend Finale

Ryker slapped a hand on her chest, the other on her ass, flipping her around. Her feet hit the floor, his cock still buried deep. She braced herself, molding earth grips over the fireplace, the heat pumping their desire. He stretched one hand across both her nipples, the other teasing her clit. Slow, he slid out of her front, then eased into her ass.



Elda:

"Oop!"

She gasped, delighted, face primed for more.



Ryker:

"Ready, my dear?"

She nodded hard, staring into the fire. He started slow, pumping steady, squeezing her nipples and clit in sync.



Elda:

"AGHHHH!"

She bit her lip, loving it. He ramped up, faster with every yelp, hitting that max speed again. Her legs hooked him tight, hands clutching her earth handles like she was riding a storm.



Ryker:

"One more trick, love!"

He shoved two fingers into her pussy, massaging her clit hard while pounding her ass.



Elda:

"OH MY GOODNESS! Ah ah ah—I wanna cum NOW!"



Ryker:

"Me too!"

His cock stiffened like stone.



Elda:

"It’s a freaking rock, Ry—I’m cumming!"



Ryker:

"Ughhhh!"

They screamed together—he squeezed everything tight, unloading into her ass as her legs yanked him deeper, her front clamping his fingers. Shaking, he stepped back, falling onto the bed with her still latched on, both a sweaty, convulsing mess.



Elda:

"Huff… not done yet, dear!"



She twisted around, straddling him reverse, ass facing him. Stroking his cock, she slowly pulled back up the water in his blood, jerking him back to life.



Ryker: 

"Oh ho ho ho—you’re a wicked woman!"



Elda: 

"Too long for just two, Ry!"

She slammed down, taking him deep in her ass again, riding hard. The air tightened, buzzing with heat, driving him wild.



Ryker:

"Ahhh—Elda, you’re killing me!"



He grabbed her hips, thrusting up to match her. SMACK SMACK—her cheeks clapped against him, sweat flying. She leaned back, hands on his chest, air still teasing his base.



Elda:

"Harder—gimme it all!"



Ryker growled, sitting up, wrapping his arms around her torso. He molded a small earth ledge under her knees, lifting her just enough to pound upward, relentlessly.



Elda:

"AH—YES—RY—I’m there again!"



Ryker:

"Same—c’mon, beloved!"



The air snapped tight, roaring hot as he erupted inside her, her screams mixing with his groan. She clenched hard, fluids dripping down his thighs, and they collapsed back, panting heavy.



Ryker:

"Hohoho, you can’t be the one to end this, I shall! Huff… one last one, my dear?"



Elda grinned, wild-eyed, sliding off slow. She waved her hand, pulling water from the basin to swirl around her fingers, glowing faint blue.



Elda:

"One last dance, dear."



She climbed over him, facing the fire, guiding his cock back to her front. The water snaked from her hand, coiling cold around her clit and his shaft, pulsing with mana. She flicked her other hand, tugging a lick of fire from the hearth to hover near, warming their skin without burning.



Ryker:

"Ooooh—that’s new!"



She rode him hard, water vibrating, fire flickering close. He grabbed her ass, slapping it red, thrusting up to meet her.



Elda:

"OH—RY—IT’S TOO GOOD!"



The water tightened, buzzing faster, the fire’s heat licking their sweat. He yanked her down, kissing her sloppy, tongues clashing as the magic shoved them over.



Elda: "I’M GOING TO CUM AGAIN—AH!"

Ryker: "UGHHH—ME TOO!"



He burst inside her, water splashing off as the fire flared and died, her shaking body gushing over him.

Both still convulsing from the climax, Ryker steps back slowly and lands back first onto the bed with Elda still attached.

Elda slumps beside him, breathless, kissing him soft. 

"It really has been too long."



Ryker grinned, pulling her close.

"Yes it has been, my love—I’ve missed this."



Elda:

"Well, thank goodness Little Ry’s tuckered out today, or he’d have heard it all!"



Ryker:

"Nah, it’s fine—he wouldn’t get it anyway. Genius or not, he’s just a baby."



They laughed warm and easy, drifting off exhausted from their backend finale, the fire crackling low.



Meanwhile, in Ryfel’s room…



Ryfel sat bolt upright, eyes wide.

"What the fuck do you mean I don’t know what’s going on? I can see and hear everything! I’m freaking over 35!"



He flopped back, impressed.



Ryfel:

"But my gosh…That was as intense as the many lovers I have had in my previous life and Sofi too. So much to learn from my parents of all people!"



Ryfel sits back down, contemplating what he just witnessed.



The Realization

Lying in his crib, Ryfel's wide eyes stared at the ceiling, his young mind racing with thoughts far beyond his years.

Ryfel (thinking, baffled):
"First of all... Did she just… move the blood in his cock???"

His tiny body plopped back down against the mattress, the sheer absurdity of what he had just witnessed washing over him.

Ryfel:
"You can actually do that in this world?"

A slow, dawning realization crept into his thoughts.

Ryfel:
"Oh my goodness… They are incorporating magic into their… coitus. This opens up so many new things. This… This world is incredible."

His brain went into overdrive. If Elda could manipulate the blood flow so precisely, then in theory…

Could he do the same?

No—more than that.

Could he control the blood in his own body?

His small fingers twitched, itching to test the theory immediately.

Then, another thought struck him like lightning—

Ryfel:
"No. Not just me… what about others?"

His mind was blazing with possibilities now.

He rolled over, gripping the blanket with renewed determination.

Ryfel (grinning internally):
"I need to try this out! But who can I try this on?”

He smirked.

Ryfel:
"I’ll have Milal take me around town tomorrow. Perfect opportunity."

His grand experiment would begin.

As his mind crafted the first steps of his new plan, his small body finally succumbed to exhaustion.

His eyes fluttered shut, but the last thought that ran through his mind before drifting into sleep was—

"This world… is full of insane potential."



The First Experiment Begins – A Walk Through Town

The morning sun shone brightly, casting a golden hue over the Redimir estate. The fresh scent of earth and dew filled the air as Ryfel completed his routine, his mind already set on the next phase of his plan.

He turned toward Milal, who had just finished helping prepare the morning meal. Today was her time to look after him, a perfect opportunity.

Ryfel (smiling, voice innocent):
"Milal, might we traverse into town today?"

He tilted his head slightly, his big, emerald-green eyes blinking up at her with perfect, calculated innocence.

Milal’s face instantly lit up.

Milal (giggling):
"Young Master, it would be an honor to bring you around!"

She clapped her hands together excitedly, completely unaware of the small, mischievous glint in Ryfel’s eyes.

His first field test was underway.



As they moved into the expansive farmland, Ryfel stooped down at random intervals, gathering small rocks and plants, tucking them neatly into his pockets.

Milal (curious):
"Young Master, what are you doing?"

Ryfel (grinning, feigning innocence):
"Exploring! Must one not understand the foundation of the land before understanding the magic that governs it?"

He molded a chunk of clay, his fingers expertly sifting through the different sediments within it. With a simple shift of mana, he extracted the purest materials, leaving the rest behind.

Milal gasped.

Milal:
"Wow! You are really smart, Young Master!"

She leaned closer, eyes wide with admiration.

Milal:
"How is it that you can understand the types of earth so fast? Oh oh! Maybe I should show you more around the whole Outer Courts! I’m sure you’ll pick up magic super fast! They use it for everything!"

Her excitement was genuine—she truly believed Ryfel was simply a brilliant child, naturally gifted.

Ryfel (internally smirking):
"Oh Milal… if only you knew."

The Town – A World of Magic in Motion

Milal led Ryfel through the bustling streets, weaving through crowded marketplaces, past merchants and craftsmen calling out their wares.

The air buzzed with magic, thick and tangible.

Everywhere he looked, he saw the practical applications of elemental manipulation—

Carpenters moved massive planks of wood using a mix of earth and water magic, shifting them seamlessly into place. Bakers kept their ovens at a constant perfect temperature, using controlled fire magic to maintain the heat. Masons reinforced walls with layers of stone magic, adjusting the structure with minimal effort. Weavers enchanted fabrics, threading mana-infused silk through delicate patterns.

Magic was everywhere, but it was practical—used for utility rather than combat.

And most importantly—

None of it was particularly impressive.

"This… is their limit?"

Ryfel had suspected as much, but now he confirmed it.

"Their magic is just… functional. They move things, shape things, guide things. But no one here truly pushes the limits of what’s possible."

His five-year-old brain raced with possibilities.



The First Encounter

As Ryfel walked through the town, absorbing the limitations of the magic around him, a faint sound caught his attention.

It was distant, just barely above the usual chatter of the market—

A frantic shuffle of feet.

A muffled sniffle.

And then—

A sharp voice, sneering.

Boy 1 (mocking):
"You think you can even use magic? You should just give up!"

Boy 2 (laughing):
"Yeah! What kind of noble can’t even use her own family’s magic properly?"

Boy 3:
"Pathetic!"

A group of young boys, likely 6 or 7 years old, had cornered someone in a small alleyway between two old stone buildings.

And in the middle of them—

A girl.

She was small, no older than four, her platinum-silver hair gleaming faintly under the setting sun.

She stood rigidly, her fists clenched tightly at her sides, her deep violet eyes trembling with frustration.

Despite the situation, she refused to cry.

Her stance was shaky, her shoulders tense—but her pride wouldn’t let her break.

Ryfel slowed his steps.

Milal, noticing his shift in attention, followed his gaze.

Milal:
"Young Master?"

But Ryfel didn’t answer.

He studied the situation carefully.

The boys weren’t just teasing her—they were testing her.

A small spark flickered from one of their palms—fire magic.

Another boy moved a tiny stone with earth magic.

Basic.

Crude.

And yet—

The girl couldn’t do even that.

"A noble… but struggling with magic?"

That was unheard of.



The lead bully stepped forward, puffing his chest.

Boy 1 (smirking):
"Go on then, Glavni girl! Show us some of your magic! Oh wait—"

He grinned cruelly.

"You can’t, can you? You were just born lucky to be in a noble family, but can’t even use magic!"

The other boys snickered, surrounding her.

The girl’s shoulders trembled, but she refused to step back.

Ryfel thought:
“Glavni? The linage of the retired Mayor?” He continued to watch on.

Kriscila (gritted teeth):
"I—I don’t need to prove anything to you."

She clenched her tiny hands into fists, her violet eyes burning with defiance.

But one of the boys shot a small stone aimlessly at her, hitting her shoulder.

She stumbled backward, her foot catching on the uneven stone road.

Kriscila fell.

Right before she could hit the ground—

A small yet firm hand grabbed her wrist.

The world paused for a second.

She blinked, breath catching in her throat.

A boy, slightly older than her, was holding her wrist.

Hair dark as midnight, but with a golden streak that gleamed under the light.

His emerald-green eyes were sharp, calculating—but there was a quiet warmth behind them.

Ryfel (calmly):
"Are they bothering you?"

The girl stared at him, completely taken aback.

The bullies hesitated.

Boy 2:
"H-Hey! Stay out of this!"

But Ryfel didn’t even acknowledge them.

Instead, he looked directly at Kriscila, his grip firm but gentle.

Her lips parted slightly, struggling to find words.

No one had ever—

But before she could say anything, Ryfel turned fully toward the bullies.



Ryfel tilted his head, observing them.

Ryfel (casually):
"So this is what you think magic is for?"

The boys flinched at his tone.

It wasn’t angry.

It wasn’t threatening.

It was just—disappointed.

Like he was looking at a bad test result.

Like he was already unimpressed.

One of the boys clenched his fists.

Boy 3:
"Sh-She’s a noble! She should at least be able to—"

Ryfel (cutting him off, uninterested):
"She should be able to what?"

He stepped forward, slowly, deliberately, his emerald gaze piercing through them.

The boys instinctively stepped back.

Ryfel (calmly):
"What’s the measure of magic to you? Parlor tricks? Throwing stones? Making tiny sparks?"

He raised his hand, and in that moment—

The earth beneath them split. A wall appeared behind them leaving only a small gap, enough for 1 person to go through.

The bullies froze as multiple stones the size of fists floated around them.

Boy 1:
“Ho-How are you able to do that?” His hand shaking from trying to control one small pebble and from fear.

The difference was clear.

The boys visibly swallowed.

Their previous confidence crumbled.

One of them grabbed the others and mumbled something before they all bolted away, squeezing through the gap in the wall frantically.



Ryfel sighed.

Ryfel (thinking, unimpressed):
"Well, that was easy."

Then, he turned his attention back to Kriscila.

She was still staring at him, eyes wide.

Ryfel (grinning slightly):
"You okay?"

She blinked rapidly, as if coming back to reality.

Kriscila (flustered, quickly standing up):
"I—I was fine! I didn’t need—"

She stopped.

Ryfel was still looking at her, amused but unbothered.

That made it worse.

Her cheeks burned slightly, but she crossed her arms, huffing.

Kriscila:
"...I could’ve handled it myself, you know."

Ryfel simply smirked.

Ryfel (casual):
"Of course."

He turned away, stepping back toward Milal, who had watched everything with her hands excitedly clasped together.



Ryfel paused mid-step.

Something about the way Kriscila stared at him—stiff, conflicted, almost reluctant—made him reconsider just walking away.

She had pride—that much was clear.

And though she was clearly frustrated, there was something else beneath her defiant glare.

Something Ryfel had seen before.

Not fear.

Not anger.

But determination.

The kind that was too stubborn to die.

So, instead of leaving, he turned back.

Ryfel (grinning):
"You know, if you wanted to prove them wrong, running away from them probably wasn’t the best idea."

Kriscila’s face flushed.

She quickly straightened her back, crossing her arms.

Kriscila:
"I—I wasn’t running away!"

She scowled, flicking her silver hair over her shoulder.

Kriscila:
"I was heading toward the Outer Wall to… to train!"

Ryfel raised an eyebrow.

Now that was interesting.

Ryfel (amused):
"The Outer Wall? What exactly were you training?"

She huffed, looking away for a moment.

Then, with visible hesitation, she pointed to the stone ground beneath them.

Kriscila:
"My earth magic. I… I was trying to move a piece of the wall."

Ryfel’s interest deepened.

Earth magic.

One of the most stable and practical forms of elemental manipulation. It was the foundation of construction, agriculture, and even combat.

But—

"She can’t even move a single stone?"

His gaze shifted to her hands.

Small. Soft.

Faint traces of dirt clung to her fingertips, like she had been digging into the ground repeatedly.

As if forcing herself to connect with something that simply refused to respond.

Ryfel crossed his arms, thinking.

Ryfel (curious):
"And?"

Kriscila’s expression darkened.

Kriscila:
"…It didn’t work."

Her fingers clenched, a brief look of frustration flashing across her face.

She quickly masked it, but Ryfel caught it instantly.

It wasn’t just irritation.

It was shame.

She was struggling with something she should have inherited naturally.

Her family name, Glavni, was well-known.

A lineage of talented land manor nobles, and magic users.

And yet—

Here she was.

Unable to move a single piece of earth.

That was why the boys mocked her. They were envious of her lineage but disappointed with her ability to wield her name.

That was why she had come here alone.

And that was why, when Ryfel had stepped in—

She hadn’t thanked him.

She wasn’t used to being saved.

She wanted to save herself.

For the first time, Ryfel felt genuine intrigue.

She wasn’t just some noble girl who had been born gifted.

She was someone struggling against expectation.

That was—admirable.

A small smirk crept onto his lips.

He extended a hand toward her.

Ryfel (calmly):
"Then let’s try again."

Kriscila’s eyes widened.

Kriscila:
"W-What?"

Ryfel:
"You said you came here to train, right?"

His voice was smooth, not mocking, not pitying—just matter-of-fact.

He nodded toward the outer wall just ahead.

Ryfel:
"Then let’s see what you’ve got."

Kriscila hesitated.

This was embarrassing.

Why would she show him her failure?

And yet—

The way he looked at her.

Not with pity. Not with expectation. Just curiosity.

No one had ever looked at her like that before.

Slowly, hesitantly, she turned toward the wall.

She raised her small hands, took a deep breath—

And focused.

Nothing.

No movement.

No shift in the stone.

The wall remained untouched.

She bit her lip, frustration creeping back.

Kriscila (muttering):
"See? It’s useless."

Ryfel, however, simply nodded to himself.

He crouched down, brushing his own hand against the wall in front of them.

For a moment—he just felt.

The texture. The material. The flow. 

It’s limestone…

Then, with an effortless motion, he lifted his hand.

A small mound of the wall started to shift.

Kriscila’s eyes widened.

Kriscila:
"You—"

Ryfel closed his fingers, and the wall went back to its original form.

Then, he looked at her.

Ryfel (calmly):
"You’re trying too hard."

She blinked.

Ryfel dusted off his hands and stood up.

Ryfel:
"You’re thinking of magic like a challenge. Like you have to force the earth to move."

He glanced at the wall, then back at her.

Ryfel:
"But the thing about earth is… it’s patient but stubborn. Let me show you."

He tapped his knuckle onto the wall.

"Place your hand here."

Ryfel then placed his hand over hers.

Ryfel:
"This is how you feel it. You don’t control it by commanding it. You understand what its made of and move with it and you guide it."

Kriscila stared at him blushing, her mouth slightly open. 

She retreated her hand and was in shock because she had never heard magic explained like that before.

Especially not from a five-year-old.

Milal (muttering, still in shock):
"Young Master, sometimes I forget how young you actually are…"

Ryfel ignored her.

Instead, he turned back to Kriscila.

Ryfel (grinning):
"What’s your name?"

She hesitated.

Then, squaring her shoulders, she lifted her chin.

Kriscila:
"Kriscila… Kriscila Glavni."

Ryfel smirked.

Ryfel:
"Then remember this, Kriscila—"

He stepped closer, leaning in slightly.

Ryfel (grinning):
"I look forward to seeing how strong you’ll become."

Kriscila’s face burned.

Kriscila (flustered, huffing):
"Hmph! I don’t need your approval!"

Ryfel simply chuckled, stepping past her toward Milal.

As he walked away, Kriscila found herself staring after him while clutching the hand he touched.

There was something about him.

Something that made her feel small—but not in a bad way.

For the first time, she wanted to chase someone’s back.

She clenched her fists, eyes burning with newfound determination.

"I’ll prove myself."

"One day… I’ll stand as your equal."

And as the sun began to set—

A new bond had been formed.

The Final Stop – Beyond the Outer Wall

Continuing his journey with Milal, Ryfel’s thoughts lingered on his brief encounter with Kriscila.

She was interesting.

She reminded him of someone.

Himself. Back in America, when he was younger.

As they walked, Milal glanced at Ryfel, still visibly processing what had just happened.

Milal (teasingly):
"Young Master, you sure have a way of leaving an impression on people."

Ryfel raised an eyebrow.

Ryfel:
"What do you mean?"

Milal chuckled, placing a hand on her hip.

Milal:
"Oh, I don’t know. Maybe it’s the way you swooped in, put those bullies in their place, and then casually gave the poor girl a philosophy lesson on magic?"

Ryfel smirked but shrugged.

Ryfel:
"I just said what made sense."

Milal tilted her head, studying him.

Milal:
"Maybe. But I think you just made a future admirer without even trying."

Ryfel paused for a moment.

Then he sighed, shaking his head.

Ryfel (muttering to himself):
"Not even trying, huh?"

It wasn’t the first time he’d influenced someone without intending to.

And judging by Kriscila’s intense look before they parted ways—

It certainly wouldn’t be the last.



As they continued walking, the streets began to widen, and the air felt different.

Cooler.

Hushed.

The bustling town behind them slowly faded, and ahead—

A massive shadow loomed.

Ryfel’s breath caught.

Standing before him was an empty field, far away from the farmlands and towns. The Wall of the Outer Rings—an 80-meter-high and 5-meters-thick fortress, pristine white, stretching far beyond what his eyes could see.

For centuries, this wall had protected Minus-Col, keeping its people safe and hidden.

And now, as Ryfel stepped closer, a thought entered his mind.

Ryfel: (Thinking) “I wonder… What is outside this wall?”

His fingers lightly brushed against the smooth limestone.

And in that moment—everything changed.

Milal:
"Um… Young Master… maybe we should head back…"

She sounded nervous. But Ryfel wasn’t listening. His hand was already pressed against the massive stone wall that had protected Minus-Col for generations.

It felt solid. Strong. Unbreakable.

But as his fingers ran over the rough surface, something clicked in his mind.

He could feel it.

The elements in the stone. It was more than just one. The materials it was made of—limestone, granite, quartz.

Ryfel:
(Thinking) "I know this."

Back in his past life, he studied these things. He knew how they were formed, structured, and used. And in this world, if he understood something…

He could move it.

The stone shifted beneath his touch.

Milal:
"Y-Young Master… what did you just do?"

Ryfel:
"Uh. I made a hole?"

Milal stared at him like he just broke reality.

Milal:
"This wall… no one’s been able to change it! Only the King and a few others would completely know what it’s made of! How did you—?"

Ryfel didn’t answer.

Because beyond the wall…

Was the outside world.



Beyond the Mist

Ryfel stepped through the hole, eyes wide as he took his first real look at the land outside of Minus-Col.

It was beautiful.

Rolling green fields stretched into the distance. Mountains stood tall against the setting sun, their peaks glowing in orange light. Trees, rivers, valleys—it was all so open compared to the kingdom he had known all his life.

But then… something felt wrong.

He looked up.

Instead of a clear sky, everything above was covered in thick, heavy clouds.

Ryfel:
"What’s with the fog?"

Milal hesitated.

Ryfel glanced at her. She looked uneasy but said nothing.

He turned back to the sky. The clouds were too perfect—not the kind that just happened.

This isn’t normal.

The more he thought about it, the more it bothered him.

The wind. The air. He could feel it moving around him. The mana flowing naturally through it.

What if I just… moved it?

Raising his hand, he willed the wind to shift.

A gust of wind shot upward, cutting through the dense fog like a knife.

And for the first time in centuries—

The sky above Minus-Col opened.

Ryfel’s breath caught.

Far beyond the valley, in the distance… he saw it.

A mountain, massive and imposing, standing in the heart of an enormous kingdom. At its peak—a castle.

A city that stretched far and wide, towering over everything like a throne of power.

His chest tightened.

Ryfel:
(Whispering) "…That must be Runevia."



Far away, in the highest room of that very castle, a man stood by a window.

The King of Runevia.

For years, he had searched for something lost. For someone who had disappeared long ago.

And now, at last—

A hole had opened in the sky.

A brief glimpse of a hidden kingdom.

His lips curled into a slow smile.

Runevia’s King:
"I finally found you."

The sky closed again, the fog rolling back into place.

But it didn’t matter.

He had seen enough.

Ryfel exhaled.

He didn’t know why, but something about that city in the distance made him feel… drawn to it.

The power, the grandeur, the feeling that something was waiting for him there.

Milal:
"Young Master! We need to go!"

Her panicked voice snapped him out of it. She grabbed his wrist, dragging him back toward the wall.

Milal:
"We were never here."

Ryfel:
“Ok Milal… I apologize, it will be our little secret.”

Ryfel took one last look at the mountain in the distance.

Then, he stepped back through the opening.

The wall sealed itself shut behind them…



That night, as Ryfel lay in bed, he stared at the ceiling.

There was so much more to learn.

The next few years… he was going to master magic.

Meanwhile, across the hall, Ryker sat in his study, staring at a new letter.

A letter from the Contender Council.

The next tournament would be in ten years.

And Ryker knew—his son would be ready.
