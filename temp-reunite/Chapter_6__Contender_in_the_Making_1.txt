Chapter 6: Contender in the Making Pt. 1



The Contender Tournament

The morning air was crisp, and the scent of freshly baked bread filled the Redimir household.

Ryfel sat at the breakfast table, watching his father lean back in his chair with a strange look of anticipation on his face.

Elda, sipping her tea, narrowed her eyes.

Elda (suspicious):
“You’re thinking about something, Ry. What is it?”

Ryker smirked, setting his cup down with a satisfied sigh.

Ryker (grinning):
“I was just thinking… it’s about time Little Ry sees what true warriors look like!”

Milal, who had been setting plates, immediately perked up.

Milal (excitedly):
“Oooooh! Does that mean what I think it means?”

Ryker slammed his hand onto the table dramatically.

Ryker (booming):
“That’s right! Today, we’re heading to the Grand Arena to watch the Contender Tournament!”

Ryfel’s ears perked up.

He had read about the tournament before in history books, but seeing it firsthand was an entirely different matter.

Ryfel (curious):
“Father, what exactly is the Contender Tournament?”

Ryker grinned like a child about to reveal a grand secret.

Ryker (proudly):
“Ah! I was waiting for you to ask, my boy! The Contender Tournament is the greatest event in all of Minas-Col! A test of strength, intellect, and leadership, where the finest warriors and brightest minds of the Outer Courts clash to determine the future of the kingdom!”

Ryfel raised an eyebrow.

Ryfel (thinking):
“Determine the future?”

Before he could ask, Ryker continued, gesturing wildly with his hands.

Ryker (enthusiastic):
“The winners of this tournament don’t just earn glory—they earn the right to shape our kingdom’s progress for the next decade! The top contenders decide how resources are distributed, how policies are made, and even what advancements are prioritized!”

Ryfel’s fingers tapped against the table as he processed the information.

Ryfel (thinking):
“So it’s not just about fighting… It’s about influence.”

Milal let out a dreamy sigh.

Milal (dramatic):
“And it’s beautiful~!”

Ryfel turned to her, amused.

Ryfel:
“Beautiful?”

Milal clasped her hands, eyes sparkling.

Milal (excited):
“Oh, Young Master, you don’t understand! It’s not just about battle! The way they dress, the way they carry themselves, the way they capture the crowd—the best contenders don’t just win fights, they win hearts!”

She leaned closer, voice lowering conspiratorially.

Milal (grinning):
“Especially the ones from the Magic District. They walk in with enchanted cloaks that make them glow. And the Blacksmith District? They practically ignite the stage just by stepping into the arena!”

Ryker groaned, rubbing his forehead.

Ryker (chuckling):
“She remembers the last tournament for all the wrong reasons.”

Milal (mock-offended):
“Nooooot true, Master Ry! I go to appreciate the art of combat! And—okay, maybe I also admire how well-dressed they are! You know how much effort goes into their outfits?”

She elbowed Ryfel playfully.

Milal (grinning):
“You better make a statement when your time comes!”

Ryfel smirked.

Ryfel (amused):
“Maybe I’ll surprise you.”

Ryker slammed his fist onto the table, laughing heartily.

Ryker (grinning):
“That’s my boy!”

As the laughter settled, Elda sighed, setting her teacup down with a soft clink.

Elda (softly):
“I understand the purpose, the history… but at the end of the day, this is still children fighting each other and even adults for power.”

Her sharp gaze settled on Ryker.

Elda (stern):
“And I will not sit there and cheer while children hurt each other for ambition.”

Ryfel, for once, didn’t disagree with her.

She wasn’t wrong.

Milal cleared her throat, sensing the tension.

Milal (cheerfully):
“Well not to be rude Madam! That just means more seats for us! I wouldn’t miss this for the world!”

Ryker chuckled, shaking his head.

Ryker (teasing):
“Milal, you’d go just to ogle the contenders.”

Milal gasped dramatically.

Milal (mock-offended):
“How dare you? I can do both, Master Ry!”

Ryker shook his head, amused.

With Elda staying behind, Ryker, Milal, and Ryfel set off toward the Grand Arena—the pride of Minas-Col.

The streets were packed.

Banners of the Five Districts hung from rooftops. Merchants called out to passersby, selling food, trinkets, and memorabilia of past Contender champions.

Children weaved through the crowds, waving flags and cheering for their favorite districts.

Ryfel sat on his father’s shoulders, taking it all in.

Ryfel (thinking):
“Wooow! This isn’t just a tournament… It’s a festival.”

Milal practically bounced with excitement.

Milal (excitedly):
“Ooooh, the Aquaculture District is selling festival food again! I hope they brought back those honey-glazed eels!”

Ryker:
“Focus, Milal! We’re here to watch, not to feast!”

Milal:
“I can do both, Master Ry!”

Then—

The family had arrived.

A massive stone coliseum looms overhead, carved columns depicting heroic figures manipulating elements—one conjuring a swirling vortex of water around farmland irrigation, another forging steel in a superheated flame.

Flags of Earth, Water, Fire, Air, and Light were draped along its mighty walls.

The crowd roared as they stepped inside.

Ryfel exhaled slowly, eyes scanning the colossal battlefield.

One day…

He’d stand in that ring.



Ryker (proudly):
 "Look at those carvings, Ryfel. Folks from every corner of Minas-Col come here to prove themselves. Someday, you’ll be on that sand, contending for our district’s place in the kingdom."

Ryfel nods, heart thumping with anticipation.

Ryker (excited whisper):
"Alright, Little Ry, we still have time before the official exhibition starts. Let’s take a look around—there’s more to see than just the main arena."

[He gestures for Ryfel to follow, leading him and Milal down a side passage bustling with vendors and performers.]

A wide courtyard spreads beneath soaring stone pillars. Colorful lanterns dangle from ropes overhead, each glowing from light magic. Dozens of stalls line the edges—some selling refreshments, others displaying enchanted gear or offering mini-games for visitors to test their skills.

Milal (clapping her hands):
"Master Ry! Young Master! Just smell that sweet steam—someone’s cooking honey-glazed eels! We have to get some!"

Ryker:
"We’ve barely taken ten steps, Milal. (chuckles) Fine, we’ll pass by the food stalls—but you need to focus on the rest of the festival too.”

Ryfel hops down from his father’s side, craning his neck to catch every detail of the lively crowd.

Ryfel (thinking):
"It’s like an entire city turned into a celebration… People from all five districts are here."

They meander through a wide courtyard bustling with elemental displays. Young contenders gather in makeshift rings, showing off to potential patrons.

A Water swordsman rapidly shifts a stream around wooden dummies, slicing with precision as though the water were a blade.

A pair of Fire fighters duel, one superheating a metal staff while the other deflects bursts of flame with hands surrounded by hardened gaunlets.

Milal waves him over to a small kiosk. A plump merchant in an apron flips eels on a sizzling pan, a sweet sauce caramelizing over them. She hands Milal a skewer, which gleams with sauce.

Milal:
"Finally! I missed this so much!"

Ryker ruffles Milal’s hair as she happily munches away, then nudges Ryfel’s shoulder.

Milal:
"Wow, I’d forgotten it was this intense here. Look, that boy’s conjuring illusions to make himself and his practice dummy multiply."

A Light specialist stands nearby, bending light around his area to produce multiple flickering copies all moving in uniform at the same time.

Ryfel (wide-eyed):
"Its all so different! They’re all so creative… This is nothing like training in the farmland."

Ryker crouches beside him, resting a hand on Ryfel’s shoulder.

Ryker:
"That’s why I wanted you to see this—there’s more to magic than just planting or shaping soil. When you stand in the arena one day, you need every advantage. Study how they use illusions, how they layer spells, how they adapt mid-fight."

Ryfel nods, heart pounding with a mix of excitement and nerves.

They exit the training hall, rejoining the main festival path. Performers dressed in flamboyant robes juggle orbs using air, while a minstrel band plays an upbeat tune infused with sparks and rainbows, spectral birds flitting around overhead in time to the music.

Milal (shaking an empty skewer):
"Master Ry, are you sure we can’t spare a moment for one more eel?"

Ryker:
"You can get more later. We haven’t even seen the official stands yet! Let’s see if they’re showcasing relics from past champions."

Ryfel perks up at that.
"Past champion relics?"

Ryker leads him toward a wide booth where old weapons and armor glisten behind glass—trophies once carried by Contender victors. A plaque notes each champion’s name, district, and greatest accomplishment.

Ryfel (reading softly):
"Aurex Solmere… Magic District… three-time champion. They say he shaped illusions so grand the arena itself transformed."

Ryker:
 "He’s a legend. He used a combination of light refraction and steam to cast illusions that confused everyone. Even those with sharp senses fell for it."

Ryfel swallows hard, imagining the level of practice and thinking required.

Ryfel (thinking):
 "This tournament shapes the kingdom’s future— It’s more than raw strength; it’s ingenuity and pure skill."



A trumpet fanfare echoes from the main coliseum entrance, signaling the pre-show about to begin. Guards in ceremonial armor file past, and the crowd surges toward the arena gates.

Milal grabs Ryfel’s hand, tugging him forward.
"Eek, hurry! The seats will get taken if we’re too slow!"

Ryker laughs, ushering Ryfel along.
"Alright, alright—enough gawking. We’ll get a prime view from the Noble’s Wing. Come on!"

The sound of cheers and fanfare roared through the coliseum, shaking the very walls as thousands of voices blended into a single, electrified mass. Trumpets blared, signaling the opening ceremony was moments away.

Ryfel hurried alongside Ryker and Milal, weaving through the throngs of nobles and high-ranking officials making their way toward the Noble Wing seating. Guards in ceremonial armor stood at attention, guiding them toward the entrance.

Just before they reached their seats, a group of men clad in Farmland District attire approached. Their expressions were serious—determined, yet carrying the quiet acceptance of contenders who had fought this battle before.



One of the older men, a broad-shouldered warrior with dust-stained boots, stepped forward and bowed lightly to Ryker.

Farmland Team Leader (respectfully):
 "Lord Redimir, it’s good to see you here."

Ryker (nodding warmly):
 "And good to see you. The team is ready?"

The man nodded, but his eyes held a somber sort of pride.

Farmland Team Leader:
 "We will fight with everything we have. I promise you that."

Another Farmland noble, an older woman with streaks of silver in her hair, spoke next.

Farmland Noble (softly):
 "The other districts have never seen us as true contenders, but today, we will make them acknowledge our strength—even if we don’t win."

Milal fidgeted slightly, avoiding eye contact. Ryfel, meanwhile, took in every word.

Ryker (gently, reassuring):
 "You don’t need to prove anything to anyone but yourselves. The honor is in trying, no matter the outcome."

There was an unspoken understanding between them all. No one truly believed they would win.

Ryfel’s small hands clenched into fists. This didn’t sit right with him.

Ryfel (thinking, frowning):
 "They know they’re going to lose… but they still walk forward anyway. They fight even when no one believes in them."

He had never felt weaker in his life. Not because he lacked strength, but because he wasn’t strong enough to help them. Not yet.

Farmland Team Leader (bowing):
 "We’ll do our best, Lord Redimir."

Ryker placed a steady hand on the man’s shoulder, offering a reassuring squeeze before they parted ways.

Ryfel remained silent, but something settled inside him—a slow-burning ember of determination.



The Noble Wing offered a perfect view of the battlefield—a grand circular arena, its floor carved with battle-worn stone, elemental scorch marks from past fights still faintly visible.

As the Redimir family took their seats, other noble families were already engaged in quiet conversations, some of which were not-so-subtly aimed at them.

A Lord from the Blacksmith District, dressed in a deep red coat embroidered with their insignia, gave Ryker a mocking smile as he approached.

Milal (pouting):
“Ugh, Varian Draganov. The Lord of Pompusness…” she mutters under her breath.

Varian (smoothly):
 "Lord Redimir, always a pleasure. I assume you’re here to support your team’s valiant effort?"

Milal shot the man a glare, clearly catching the mockery.

Milal (tongue sticking out):
"If smugness was a weapon, he’d already be the champion."

Ryfel glanced at his father, curious to see how he would respond.

Ryker (calm, smiling slightly):
 "Every district deserves to stand on this battlefield, win or lose. But tell me—how do you feel about your contenders this year?"

The Blacksmith noble's smirk twitched slightly at being redirected.

Varian:
 "As always, we will dominate the combat trials, especially now with my sons. Unlike some districts, we don’t waste time on fields and irrigation."

More nobles chuckled at the jab.

Ryfel’s fingers dug into his seat, but Ryker never lost his composure.

Ryker (chuckling, eyes sharp):
 "They say a good weapon is an extension of the warrior. But from what I’ve seen, your sons swing first and think later. Maybe sharpen their minds before their blades?"

The chuckles turned into quiet laughter, some nobles clearly enjoying the exchange.

Varian’s face darkened slightly.

Varian(coldly):
 "Hmph. Coming from a district that can’t even win a trial."

Ryker smiled, completely unfazed.

Ryker (grinning slightly):
"Maybe. But at least our men surprise people. Everyone already knows exactly what yours will do."

The nobles’ quiet chuckles turned into murmurs.

Varian stiffened, the insult hitting deeper than expected. He opened his mouth, then exhaled sharply, turning back toward his booth without another word.



The arena floor darkened, and then, in an instant, bright elemental flares erupted opening up from the earth and into the air—flames, gusts of wind, bursts of water, shimmering illusions of light.

The crowd erupted in thunderous applause as the announcer’s voice boomed across the coliseum.

A massive drumbeat shook the stadium. Then another. And another.

BOOM. BOOM. BOOM.

With each thunderous beat, the crowd’s excitement swelled, their cheers echoing through the coliseum like crashing waves. The giant banners of the five districts billowed above, their vibrant colors illuminated by the midday sun.

Ryfel sat rigid in his seat, his small fingers curled against the stone armrest. The energy in the air was unlike anything he had ever felt before.

Announcer (booming):
 "Welcome, citizens of Minas-Col, to the Contender Tournament!"

The crowd roared, shaking the very foundations of the Grand Arena.

From the colossal entrance gates, the five district teams marched forward in formation, each led by their team captain, their heads held high as they approached the center of the arena.

Announcer:
"Representing the Blacksmith District!"

The ground trembled as the heaviest warriors in the tournament strode forward. Their fiery-red cloaks whipped in the wind, their massive weapons resting on their shoulders like they weighed nothing. 

The three sons of Varian: Garrik Draganov (18) – The strongest, naturally gifted, but arrogant. Viktor Draganov (17) – Cunning and technical, he focused on strategy. Tomas Draganov (16) – Reckless, impatient, thrives on aggression. 

All large in size, muscled to the teeth with their own unique set of weapons and armor.

However, among the giants, a boy half their size weirdly stood out. Porter Wheelbarren (15), was not part of the family and seemed to just be carrying all the other equipment for the three sons.

The cheers were deafening.

Milal (grumbling):
 "Ugh, of course they get the loudest cheers. Look at them—strutting like they already won."

Ryfel (watching closely, thinking):
 "They act like they own the battlefield. But maybe power alone won’t win them everything."



Announcer:
 "Representing the Magic District!"

A group of elegantly dressed warriors entered, their light-woven cloaks shimmering, each step causing subtle distortions in the air around them.

A dazzling wave of refracted sunlight swirled above them—a carefully crafted display of light-bending mastery.

The crowd "oooh"-ed and "ahhh"-ed, mesmerized by the display.

Milal (smiling):
 "Ooooooh, they look strong!"

Ryker (smirking):
 "Theatrics help win wars too, Milal. Never underestimate the power of perception."

Ryfel’s eyes narrowed slightly. He wasn’t watching the light—he was watching the movement.

Ryfel (thinking):
 "Their cloaks bend light around them, making them harder to track… but that distortion means they still have a presence. I wonder if there’s a way to counter it…"



Announcer:
 "Representing the Transport District!"

The wind itself shifted, kicking up dust as figures clad in sleek, aerodynamic armor sprinted onto the field—faster than any normal human should be.

They didn’t walk—they glided. Light-footed, wind-assisted movements carried them forward in swift, controlled bursts.

The crowd gasped at their raw speed.

Milal (eyes wide):
 "Woah! They’re fast… like really fast."

Ryfel (studying them):
 "Speed alone isn’t unbeatable. But I wonder what they can really do?"



Announcer:
 "Representing the Aquaculture District!"

The arena floor rippled like water as the fluid warriors of the Aquaculture District stepped forward, their movements as smooth as a river’s current.

A spiral of controlled water coiled around them, shifting between liquid, mist, and hardened ice in seconds.

The applause was steady, their reputation as tacticians and adaptability experts already well-known.

Ryfel (watching closely):
 "Water changes form constantly… they can shift their strategy mid-fight. That makes them dangerous."



Finally… Farmland’s Turn.

Announcer:
 "And finally… representing the Farmland District."

The cheers softened.

The team stepped forward, their earth-toned cloaks blending almost too well into the worn battlefield. They weren’t flashy. They weren’t overwhelming.

They simply walked forward—heads held high, but the weight of expectation (or the lack of it) settled over them like a cloud.

The applause was polite.

Not weak. But not strong either.

Milal (quietly):
 "...They didn’t cheer as loud."

Ryfel’s fingers tightened against the stone seat.

Ryfel (thinking):
 "What makes us so different? Is it our magic? Our fighting style? Or something deeper?"

He hated that feeling of being looked down on. That dismissal.



The announcer’s voice rang through the coliseum, signaling the start of the first trial.

Announcer:
 "Now, we begin the first challenge—a test of combat, teamwork, and resilience! Five teams enter, only one will claim victory!"

The crowd erupted in anticipation.

Milal (grinning, nudging Ryfel):
 "Here we go! Our team’s gonna fight soon!"

Ryker (calmly, watching the arena):
 "Pay close attention, Little Ry. This isn’t just about watching—it’s about learning."

Ryfel’s eyes never left the battlefield.

This was it.

The first real test.



The First Trial

The arena cracked with energy as teams clashed violently in the center of the field.

Transport District warriors darted between the chaos, their wind-enhanced movements making them a blur. One of them slid low under an Aquaculture fighter’s sweeping kick, using a burst of air to propel themselves up and over the battlefield like a gust of wind.

Magic District stayed on the outskirts, their warriors light on their feet, manipulating their illusions to mislead opponents. Every time someone thought they had a Magic fighter cornered, they’d strike—only to find nothing but empty air.

Meanwhile, Blacksmith tore through everything in their path.

Garrik’s greatsword cleaved through a Transport fighter’s defenses, sending them crashing into the dirt. Tomas laughed wildly as he tackled an Aquaculture warrior, slamming them into the ground with enough force to shake the arena.

Farmland, meanwhile, still held position.

Milal shifted in her seat. 

Milal (groaning):
"Nuuuu, they’re just standing there! Do they even have a plan?"

Ryker (calmly):

"They’re controlling the field. Milal"

Sure enough, when Transport District finally made their move against Farmland, it didn’t go as expected.



A Transport warrior zipped toward them, intent on breaking their defense. They dodged around the first earth wall, then vaulted over another.

Just as they were about to land—the ground beneath them suddenly collapsed.

The warrior’s eyes widened as they fell into a hidden trench, their momentum stolen in an instant.

A second Transport fighter **darted low, aiming to slide between the defenses—**only to slam headfirst into a rising wall of stone.

Milal (shocked):

"They—they actually stopped them?"

Ryfel (murmuring):

"They’re not fighting head-on. They’re making the others do all the work."

Ryfel’s fingers pressed against his seat as he analyzed every movement.

For a moment, it seemed like Farmland’s strategy was working.

Blacksmith was occupied with Aquaculture.

Magic was waiting in the shadows, watching.

And Transport had just eliminated themselves by rushing in blindly.

Farmland had outlasted one team already.

But they wouldn’t last much longer.



Magic District moved next.

A blinding flash of refracted light burst across the battlefield, disorienting everyone nearby. Transport, already off balance, became easy prey.

Tomas didn’t waste the opportunity. He rushed forward, grabbing one of the Transport fighters by the leg, swinging him into the ground with terrifying ease.

Another Magic warrior used the distraction to launch a focused beam of light at the last standing Transport fighter, sending them flying.

A moment later, the gong rang out.

Announcer (booming):

"Transport District—eliminated!"

The crowd roared, but Ryfel barely registered the noise.

He was too busy watching Viktor Draganov, the only Blacksmith fighter who hadn’t charged in blindly.

The strategist.

And he was looking at Farmland now.



Aquaculture had been playing smart, too.

Instead of fighting head-on, they spread water across the battlefield, turning the terrain into slippery mud. It was a direct counter to Blacksmith, forcing their heavy warriors to slow down.

For a while, it worked.

Then Garrik adjusted.

With a simple shift of his stance, he ignited his greataxe, slamming it into the mud and turning it into hardened stone.

A second later, Tomas took down the first Aquaculture warrior, smashing him straight through the ground.

One by one, Aquaculture was overwhelmed.

Another gong.

Announcer (booming):

"Aquaculture District—eliminated!"

The crowd erupted again.

Farmland was still standing.

But now, they were alone.



Now it was just three teams.

Blacksmith had taken damage, but their warriors were still standing.

Magic had barely fought yet.

And Farmland?

Their walls were crumbling.

Garrik cracked his neck, rolling his shoulders. 


Garrik (shouting):
"Enough hiding. Let’s finish this."

The moment Blacksmith and Magic both turned to Farmland, the outcome was clear.

They wouldn’t win.

But they wouldn’t go down without a fight.



The first break in their defense came from Magic.

A beam of refracted light shot forward, slipping through a crack in their defenses, blasting the first Farmland warrior out of bounds.

Blacksmith took that moment to strike.

Viktor called out a command, and Garrik and Tomas rushed forward together, smashing through what remained of the barriers.

Magic wasn’t attacking Blacksmith.

They were letting them do all the work.

The last Farmland fighter stood alone, battered but unbroken.

He tried to raise one last defense—before a blinding light caught him off guard.

A moment later, a final strike from Garrik ended the fight.

The gong sounded.

Announcer (booming):

"Farmland District—eliminated!"

The cheers were polite.



The battlefield was almost silent as the Magic and Blacksmith warriors stood tall.

Announcer (booming):
"And now… the final two!"

The crowd exploded into cheers, all eyes on the two remaining teams.

Ryfel barely heard them.

His hands had curled into fists.

Farmland had lasted longer than expected.

And yet, no one cared.

Milal (cheering):

"Well… they weren’t first to lose?"



Ryfel didn’t answer.

Ryker placed a steady hand on his shoulder.



Ryker (calmly):

"They fought well, Ryfel."

But that wasn’t enough.

Not for Ryfel.

One day, he would be down there.

And when he fought, it wouldn’t be just to last longer.

He would win.

Ryfel (muttering):
“I’d win… The way my district fought… I would have won, if… it was me.”

Ryfel stared at his district warriors walking with their heads held high, coming in better than expected. His toes suddenly curled, as though it was in shame or even deep disgust.

Ryfel (muttering):
“I don’t understand this… How… How can you walk in pride, coming in third place?” He muttered viciously.

I have never lost before… In the Navy SEALS, coming out unscathed with my team in a 5 vs 100 mission, my first time running senator, and my first ever run to be Vice Preside…” 

Ryfel’s heart heated up. His eyes were wide and peeled to the battlefield in a sight that would burn through a man’s skull…

He was enraged. Clenching his fists till even his short fingernails dug into his skin.

Ryfel (enraged):
“Ten more years… Ten more fucking years… I will take the stage.”

The Final Clash

The battlefield, once a sprawling arena filled with five teams, had been reduced to just two.

The Magic District stood untouched, barely winded, their light-refraction cloaks shimmering under the midday sun. They moved in perfect formation, their expressions calm, calculating.

The Blacksmith District, in contrast, was battered and bruised, but unyielding. Garrik Draganov rolled his shoulders, his greatsword resting on one massive shoulder, his breath steady despite the exhaustion creeping into his muscles. 

His younger brothers stood behind him, Veyron’s sharp gaze flickering between their opponents, analyzing, searching for an opening.

The two districts locked eyes.

The final round began.

A hush fell over the crowd.

And then—Magic disappeared.

The battlefield fractured into an endless mirage, the arena stretching and folding in on itself like rippling water. The real Magic warriors were nowhere to be seen—only their illusions remained.

Garrik reacted instantly. He swung his greatsword with all his strength, flames erupting along its length as he cleaved through the air. A dozen false figures of the Magic warriors were shattered like glass.

And yet—nothing.

None of them were real.

A faint flicker of light to his right—too late.

A concentrated beam of light shot straight through his armor, hitting just under his ribs. Garrik staggered, gritting his teeth, refusing to fall.

Behind him, Tomas roared and charged, fists coated in molten rock, swinging wildly at the illusions.

Every hit missed.

Magic wasn’t fighting them. They were dismantling them.

Viktor was the first to realize. His sharp eyes darted across the battlefield, ignoring the illusions, searching for the shadows. That was the trick—light could only bend so much. The real fighters had to be casting shadows.

There. A fraction of a movement, the way the dust swirled unnaturally in the air.

Viktor (shouting):

"Garrik! To your—"

Too late.

A final flash of blinding white light exploded across the battlefield.

When the glow faded, Garrik was on one knee, his weapon buried in the ground for support.

Viktor stood still, his body locked in place, the realization sinking in. The blades of the Magic district at each and every one of their throats.

They had lost.

The gong rang out one last time.

Announcer (booming):

"And with that—The Magic District wins the first trial!"

The roar of the crowd was deafening.

The Magic warriors stood unscathed, their victory never once in question.

The Blacksmith warriors, tough as they were, had never stood a chance.

As the dust settled, Garrik slowly pushed himself up. His face was unreadable as he glanced toward the victors. Then, without a word, he turned away, his brothers falling in step behind him.

The Magic warriors didn’t gloat. They did not need to.

They had already proven their superiority.

The battlefield was cleared as the next trial was prepared, but Ryfel still hadn’t moved from his seat.

Milal let out a deep breath, slumping against the stone bench. 

Milal:
"Well… that was brutal."

Ryker nodded slightly, eyes on the departing Blacksmith team. 

Ryker:
“They were outmatched before the fight even started.”

Milal (groaned): 
“I was hoping for a crazy last-minute comeback. Y’know, like a big explosion or something. Although it was nice to see those cocky buggers lose! I think also—”


Milal’s voice droned on and on to Ryker.

However, Ryfel barely heard them.

His gaze remained locked on the Magic warriors.

They had fought without fighting.

They had won without effort.

And no one had doubted them for a second.

That’s what true dominance looked like.







Lost in Rage

The trials continued… The arena erupted in celebrations, the voices of thousands rising in excitement, yet to Ryfel, it all felt like distant echoes.

The noise around him was deafening, but to Ryfel, it barely existed.

His breath was steady, but only because he forced it to be. His mind, sharp beyond its years, had fractured into something deeper, something colder. He wasn’t watching the trials anymore.

He was watching every misstep. Every failure. Every moment where Farmland’s warriors had fallen short.

Ryfel’s stomach twisted. His fingers curled tighter against his lap, pressing into his palm until the pain grounded him.

A shiver ran through his spine, but it wasn’t from the cold.

It was disgust.

He had always been a man of control. In his past life, power had not been something given to him—it had been something he took. Something he bent to his will.

And yet, here he was.

Watching his district become nothing more than an afterthought.

His hands sat clenched in his lap, the skin of his knuckles stretched pale. His nails had bitten so deep into his palms that a dull sting pulsed with every beat of his heart, but he didn’t loosen his grip. 

The pain was grounding. It was the only thing keeping him anchored as the storm inside him raged.

His vision remained locked on the battlefield, though he wasn’t really seeing anymore. The fights had continued, trial after trial, but he had registered none of it.

The shifting battlefield, the roars of the crowd, the flashes of elemental combat—all of it had blurred into static.

All he could see were the warriors of Farmland walking off the field. Heads high. Backs straight. Third place.

How could they celebrate when they had been so pathetic?

They had lost.

They had LOST.

The polite claps had burned into his ears more than the cheers for Magic’s victory. They weren’t hated. They weren’t respected.

They were dismissed.

It made his skin crawl.

Milal had said something beside him, something about third place not being so bad, but it had barely registered before his mind had already been swallowed whole by the thought that had been festering inside him from the moment the fight ended.

Ryfel (muttering):
"I would have won."

The thought had first whispered in the back of his mind. Now, it roared.

Ryfel (obessesed):
"If it had been me, I wouldn’t have let them take control. I wouldn’t have let them dictate the battlefield. I wouldn’t have—"

His body was burning. The weight of the emotions crushed down on his chest, filling him with something too big for a five-year-old’s body to contain.

But he wasn’t just five.

Not in mind. Not in experience.

His past life flooded him in waves.

The first time he had stepped into combat, outnumbered, outgunned, facing an army meant to crush him. But he hadn’t lost. They hadn’t even touched him.

His first election. A battle of power, strategy, and influence. They had said he had no chance, and yet, when the votes were counted, there had been no competition.

His first bid for Vice President. The odds had been against him from the start. And yet, when the dust had settled, his name had been the only one left standing.

He had never lost before.

Not once.

Not until now.

Not until this life.

His heart pounded in his ears, drowning out the stadium, the voices, the cheering. His fingers curled tighter into his skin, his nails digging deeper, but the sharp sting did nothing to dull the searing rage burning inside him.

Ryfel (thinking):
"Ten years."

His breath came sharp, but he barely felt it.

"Ten more years and I will take the stage."

His mind wasn’t in the present anymore. He was already ten years into the future, stepping onto that battlefield, standing where his warriors had fallen.

"No one will be above me."

His breathing had slowed. Deep. Controlled. He wasn’t just imagining it anymore. He was planning.

Where he would strike first.
What kind of terrain he would manipulate.
How he would counter the illusions.
How he would break them—one by one—until only he remained.

Ryfel (thinking):
"I will take the stage. And I will win."

The crowd roared again, shaking the stadium. Another trial had ended, but Ryfel had seen none of it.

His mind was too far gone.



Suddenly, a much-needed hand warmly pressed against his shoulder.

The storm inside him cracked.

It wasn’t abrupt. Not jarring. But the heat that had swallowed him whole shifted ever so slightly, like something had disturbed its center.

The pressure of the fingers grounded him, pulling him back to the now.

Ryker (gentle):
“Ryfel.”

The voice was steady. Calm. A presence that had been beside him all this time, but one he had shut out completely.

His breath caught, the tunnel in his mind widening just enough for him to realize something was wrong.

The noise of the stadium returned. The brightness of the arena was too sharp. The weight on his chest was suffocating.

His muscles felt locked, like if he let them go, he would lose himself all over again.

The fingers pressed slightly. Firm. Grounding.

Ryker (gentle):
“Ryfel.”

His father’s voice was still calm, but there was something unshakable underneath it.

He turned his head, his movements slow, deliberate. His father was looking at him—not with confusion, not with concern, but with the kind of expression only a soldier would recognize.

Assessing. Calculating. Dominating,

Ryker had seen it.

He had seen where Ryfel had gone.

His father didn’t say anything else, didn’t pry, didn’t ask what had held him so deep in his own head that he had lost awareness of everything around him. He just… watched.

Ryfel exhaled sharply, forcing his fingers to loosen, the deep indent of his nails still pulsing against his skin.

A new voice cut through his haze.

Milal:
“You totally missed everything! 

I was talking to you the whole time! I was telling you about the inventions and stuff—well, they were kinda boring, so I don’t blame you for zoning out, but still! At least pretend to listen next time!”

Milal huffed, stuffing a honey-glazed skewer in her mouth before speaking again. 

Ryfel barely reacted. His heartbeat still hadn’t settled.

He turned his eyes back to the arena. The field had been cleared. The final match was about to begin.

His father withdrew his hand, the warmth fading, but the effect had already settled in.

Ryker:
“You won’t accomplish anything if you let anger blind you,”

Ryfel’s hands clenched again, but this time, they didn’t tremble.

Ryfel:
“I know.”

Ryker nodded once, approving, then looked forward as the final competitors stepped onto the battlefield.

Ryker:
“Good, then watch.”

Ryfel took a breath. He let it settle.

And this time, he watched calmly.



The Final Match Begins

The battlefield was cleared, reset to pristine condition, but the weight of the tournament hung heavy in the air.

The final match was about to begin.

Two warriors. One title.

The announcer’s voice rang through the coliseum, thick with anticipation.

Announcer (booming):

"And now… the final duel of the Contender Tournament! Representing the Blacksmith District—Garrik Draganov!"

The crowd erupted in cheers as Garrik stepped forward, his greatsword slung over his shoulder, his body covered in battle scars from the previous rounds. He had fought through fire and steel, endured the brutality of this tournament to stand here now.

His stance was solid. His resolve, unshaken.

But his opponent stood across from him—untouched, unbothered.

Announcer (booming):

"And facing him, the undefeated Champion, the pride of the Magic District—AUREX SOLMERE!"

“Aurex! Aurex! Aurex!”

If the cheers for Garrik were loud, the roar that followed Aurex’s name was deafening.

The cheers still thundered through the coliseum, the stadium shaking with the sheer force of thousands chanting one name.



Garrik exhaled slowly, rolling his shoulders, gripping his blade tightly, annoyed as he witnessed the worship that surrounded the man before him.

The Champion, however, hadn't even lifted his weapon.

Hadn’t even acknowledged him.

A smirk curled at Garrik’s lips, though there was no humor in it. He tilted his head, letting his voice cut through the lingering roars.

Garrik (scoffing):

"All this noise for you? Hmph. You’d think they were cheering for a real fighter."

Aurex didn’t flinch. Didn’t react. His expression remained still, passive—indifferent.

The disregard irked Garrik immediately.

Garrik (laughing):

"Tch. That’s your trick, huh? Just standing there looking pretty while everyone pisses themselves at your name?"



Aurex’s gaze remained distant, unbothered.



Garrik’s jaw flexed, his smirk widening, voice dropping just slightly—lower, sharper.



Garrik (taunting):

"Go on then, Champion. Do something. Make me believe you’re worth all this screaming."

A few nobles in the stands stirred at the provocation. Some chuckled, some whispered, watching to see if the perfect, untouchable Aurex Solmere would finally react.

Nothing.

Not a blink.

Not even a breath out of place.

Aurex merely exhaled softly, like Garrik’s words had barely reached him.

And then, without turning his head, he finally spoke.

Aurex (nonchalant):
"Are you always this loud before you lose?"

Completely disinterested. He dug his ear with his pinky. Started waving to the crowd and his daughter in the booth.

The crowd roared.

Garrik’s grin stiffened just slightly before twisting into something darker, something eager.

Garrik (grinning):
"We’ll see what happens when you lose in front of your daugther."

And then the gong rang.



Garrik didn’t waste time.

He knew what was coming. He had seen what the Magic warriors had done to his brothers in the Team Battle. He wasn’t about to let this fight turn into a game of illusions and tricks.

He moved first, fast, and without hesitation.

His greatsword came down like a hammer, the sheer force of his charge splitting the ground beneath his feet. Flames erupted along the blade’s edge, a roaring wall of fire cutting through the air toward Aurex.

But the Champion was already gone.

A twist of his wrist, a simple shift in his weight, and Aurex’s form blurred, his figure bending with the light—and the flames passed through empty space.

No illusion.

Just raw, impossible speed.

The crowd gasped.

Garrik’s eyes barely widened before Aurex was on him.

The Swallow spun in his hands, its twin blades whispering through the air. A flash of silver aimed precisely—not to kill, but to dictate.

Garrik raised his sword just in time, intercepting the first strike. The impact shivered through his arms, the weight of the Swallow deceptively light yet unrelenting.

Then it moved again.

A second strike. A third. A blur of rapid, precise slashes that forced Garrik back, back, back.

Aurex was pushing him, guiding him.

Controlling him.

Garrik (growling):

"You don’t get to decide how this fight goes."

He planted his feet. Then, with a grunt, he forced a counter swing—heavy, explosive, breaking through the rhythm Aurex had set.

For the first time, Aurex had to move.

And that was the mistake Garrik had been waiting for.

He pivoted, twisting his body mid-motion, and with a single downward cleave, he brought his greatsword straight for Aurex’s blind spot.

The attack landed. The ground below Aurex seemed to have split open under his feet, and a cloud of dust burst forth from the hit.

The crowd gasped.

But it wasn’t flesh his blade met.

It was steel.

Aurex’s Swallow had intercepted the strike mid-air, tilting the force of Garrik’s blow at an angle so perfectly aligned that not a single shockwave passed through his body, landing to the floor.

Sweat started to slid down Garrik’s temple.

He had hit nothing.

Again.

And Aurex?

Aurex exhaled.

A slow, measured breath.

And then, he moved.

The Swallow spun in his hands, and everything shifted.

One moment, Garrik was holding his ground.

Next, he was being dragged into a dance he couldn’t lead.

Every attack he threw was redirected.

Every swing, every strike—absorbed and neutralized, then punished.

Aurex didn’t block.

He didn’t resist.

He simply moved.

Garrik swung high—Aurex ducked.

A follow-up from the side—Aurex twisted, stepping into the space Garrik had left open.

And then—pain.

A burst of refracted light hit Garrik’s side, sending him stumbling, his breath knocked from his lungs.

The Swallow followed immediately.

A flash of silver—his wrist.

A second strike—his leg.

Neither were deep. Neither were fatal.

But they were precise.

A calculated dismantling of his stance, of his control.

The realization settled into Garrik’s bones.

He wasn’t losing.

He was being taken apart.

The crowd felt it too.

The tension in the coliseum had shifted, the energy leaning, bending toward an inevitable outcome.

Aurex Solmere had already won.

Garrik saw it now—the fight had been decided the moment it began.

And yet.

The Draganov bloodline had never been one to accept fate.

Garrik gritted his teeth, his muscles screaming in protest, but he did not fall. His mind worked through every possibility, every failure so far, and something inside him—something deeper, something primal—rose from within.

If he couldn’t hit Aurex as he was now…

Then he would change the game.



A slow breath almost looking like steam or smoke left his lips deep and controlled. His fingers flexed, the heat of his magic coiling beneath his skin.

Then, with a single stomp, the battlefield shook.

The earth responded to his call, rising in shifting layers that wrapped around his body, forming jagged plates of molten armor over his weak spots—his ribs, his joints, his back.

Not just protection.

A living forge.

The heat surged. Smoke hissed from his body, steam curling off his arms, his chest, his legs. The air around him distorted, waves of heat rippling outward.

The temperature of the battlefield rose instantly.

A few nobles in the stands muttered in surprise.

This wasn’t just reinforcement.

It was a furnace.

Every strike Aurex had landed before? Those points were now covered in metal superheated. Every attack against Garrik now risked melting a blade, searing flesh, turning the very battlefield into his domain.

His breath fogged from the sheer heat. His greatsword didn’t just glow—it roared, the metal pulsing with raw, fiery power.

And then, he moved.



Aurex shifted—not out of fear, not out of panic, but out of caution.

For the first time, Garrik was forcing him to react.

The Swallow met the first strike, but the moment metal clashed against Garrik’s body, a violent hiss burst into the air. The twin blades of the Swallow didn’t glide against him like before.

They burned.

Aurex’s hand twitched.

Garrik (grinning):

"Not so untouchable now, are you?"

With a second stomp, he forced another eruption of molten earth, sending a wave of searing heat directly at Aurex.

The Champion dodged, twisting with an effortless step, but his grace had been interrupted.

That was all Garrik needed.

Garrik (Scoffing):
“I already know how you fight old man! All you do is dance! You can’t dance anymore with a broken floor!”

He surged forward, swinging wild, powerful, molten strikes, forcing Aurex to retreat.

The crowd gasped.

Aurex was losing ground.

Milal nearly jumped out of her seat. 

Milal (excited):

"H-he’s actually hitting back!"

Ryfel wasn’t watching the fight anymore.

He was watching Aurex.

Watching what came next.

Because the Champion wasn’t losing.

He was adapting.

A soft breath left Aurex’s lips.

And then, for the first time, he truly moved.

Not just with speed.

Not just with precision.

But with a plan.

His footwork shifted, subtly, deliberately. His fingers traced the air, and Garrik, focused on keeping up his relentless assault, didn’t see it—the battlefield was already against the molten madman.



Thin, scattered shards of mirrors had been planted around the arena—reflecting fragments of the battlefield in broken angles, warping reality ever so slightly.

And as Garrik exhaled smoke, as his own steam filled the air…

Aurex welcomed it. He dashed close to Garrik with an unimpressed look.

Aurex:
“Let me show you what a true dance is.”

The Champion leaped back once, twice—took a deep mana-filled breath and exhaled a soft stream of air-laced water magic, sending a cool mist cascading through the battlefield.

A moment later, the vapor shifted.

Broke.

Multiplied.

The crowd gasped.

Because now—there weren’t just one or two illusions.

There were dozens.

Each moving at their own pace.

Not like the Magic District’s usual tricks.

This wasn’t a house of mirrors.

This was a battlefield of ghosts.

Garrik slowed.

Not because he wanted to.

Because he had to.

Because for the first time in this entire fight, he could not tell what was real.

Aurex wasn’t just dodging anymore.

He wasn’t redirecting attacks.

He was nowhere—and everywhere.

Ryfel’s breath hitched. His fingers pressed against his seat.

His mind worked, analyzed. He’d seen Magic District illusions before. He’d seen their tricks, their misdirections.

But this… this was different.

The illusions weren’t just reflections.

They were fighting independently.

Cuts started appearing one by one in predictable ways, forcing Garrik to defend against nothing.

Others flickered just behind his blind spots, slicing through his reactions a second too late.

Even when Garrik’s molten armor kept him from being overwhelmed immediately, the result was clear.

It was happening again. Aurex was taking him apart. Garrik’s armour was dissected piece by piece.

[SNKT! SNKT! SNKT!]

And Ryfel could see it.

This wasn’t just strategy.

This was an artform. Aurex was no longer fighting. He was conducting.

And Ryfel memorized every movement.

The placement of the mirrors. The angle of the light. The flow of the vapors.

The way each illusion moved at a slightly different rhythm, making it impossible to track.

This wasn’t just magic.

This was dazzling.

And it infuriated Ryfel, even though Garrik was the one facing it.

The fight had ended before Garrik even realized it.

Garrik:
“Hufff, huff. Where??! Where is he?!?!”

Swinging as a molten madman but in a truer sense of mad. He threw one final, desperate strike, his sword cutting through four Aurexes at once.

Only to find them all cut into mist.

And the real one?

Behind him.

Aurex didn’t strike to kill.

He didn’t strike to harm.

With a single, precise movement, the Swallow’s twin blades crossed Garrik’s throat.

A beat of silence. The mist burst clear around Garrik revealing to the crowd the finale.

Then the gong rang.

Announcer (booming):

"And still undefeated—AUREX SOLMERE WINS!"





The stadium shook with applause.

Aurex lowered his weapon.

Without a single scratch on his body, he turned, his silver cloak as untouched as the moment he stepped onto the battlefield.

The perfect Champion.

The untouchable force.

And Ryfel both hated and admired it.

Not the strength. Not the skill. But the fact that no one could even touch him.

This wasn’t about fighting. This was absolute control. Aurex didn’t just win.

He made it so no one else ever stood a chance.

Ryker (calmly):

"What do you see, Ryfel?"

Ryfel’s fingers clenched.

Ryfel (muttering):

"A maestro."



Ryker (smirking):

"And what will you be in ten years?"

Ryfel, with eyes glued to the champion like a predator, jaw tightened, his heart slow and steady.

Ryfel (sharply):

"The one who breaks his technique, and ultimately, him."



The stadium shook with applause, a sea of voices roaring in unquestionable victory for Aurex Solmere, the undefeated Champion. The Magic District’s nobles stood, smiling in quiet satisfaction, their warriors basking in the glory of yet another uncontested win.

But in the Blacksmith District’s noble booth—

There was no applause.

A heavy crack split through the air.

Then—the table flipped.

The grand wooden banquet table splintered under Lord Varian Draganov’s sheer strength, goblets and silverware clattering to the floor, the leftover wine spilling like blood across the stone.

The noise cut through the cheers, sharp as a blade. Nobles flinched, eyes snapping toward the towering warlord of the Blacksmith District.

His steel-gray eyes burned with fury, his chest rising and falling in deep, controlled breaths.

Varian:

"This was an embarrassment."

Garrik had barely reached the stands when his father’s piercing glare met him head-on.

Varian (growling):
“On your knees,” 

His words were as heavy as an executioner’s hammer.

Varian (growling):
“Before a ‘dancer’, lost like a clown.” 

His lip curled, his disgust palpable. 

Varian:
“Is this what the Draganov name has come to?”

Garrik’s breath hitched, but he held his father’s gaze. He had fought his hardest.

He had pushed past Aurex’s untouchable illusionary tricks and even forced the Champion into using his final technique.

But none of it mattered.

Garrik:
“I—”

Varian:
“Enough.”

The single word slammed into him harder than any strike Aurex had landed.

Varian turned without another glance, his heavy boots slamming against the stone as he stormed out. The crowd moved out of his way without a word.

Viktor and Tomas hesitated for only a moment before following after their father, their expressions unreadable.

Garrik stood there, fists clenched, his molten armor cooling into dead weight.

He was no longer worth looking at.



Fire Burning from the ‘Dancefloor’

The return home was quiet.

The fire of the Grand Arena had been left behind, but its embers of combat still burned in Ryfel’s mind.

Milal had talked non-stop in the carriage, her excitement bubbling over. She had gushed about Garrik’s fiery transformation, about Aurex’s illusions, about how she’d never seen a fight like that in her life.

Ryker had responded here and there, his voice always steady, composed.

But Ryfel?

Ryfel had remained silent.

His body relaxed against the seat, his posture loose, his eyes half-lidded like he was drifting to sleep.

A perfect ‘illusion’.

The moment they returned to the estate, he played the part flawlessly—a tired child, exhausted from a long day, Ryker gently putting him into bed.

As the door closed, the family turning in, He listened.

The muffled voices in the hallway. The soft padding of footsteps.

Then, finally—silence. And in that silence, Ryfel’s eyes flashed open.

He sat up slowly, his breath measured, his fingers pressed against his lap. His mind immediately diving deep down into the events of today.

The fight began.

Not in front of him—but within him.

He placed himself in Garrik’s stance. The molten armor, the greatsword, the overwhelming heat. He swung, chased, and burned the battlefield.

And he lost.

He reset.

He placed himself in another warrior’s stance. Faster, sharper. Someone who could react to Aurex’s movements in time. He dodged, struck from angles Garrik hadn’t considered.

And lost.

Again.

And again.

And again.

No matter what approach he took. No matter how skilled, fast, or powerful he imagined himself to be. He could not win.

Because he did not understand.

How did the illusions work? How did Garrik get hit from every side at once when there was only one Aurex? Why did nothing he imagined let him escape defeat?

His hands tightened into fists.

Then—

A memory.

A name.

Casper. Casper Masculine.

A man who fooled armies, deceived generals, and made entire warships disappear during World War II.

He wasn’t just a magician.

He was the phantom strategist—the illusionist who had shaped the war without ever lifting a blade.

When the Nazis invaded, he created entire armies magically to fight for the British.

He had once led an army of ghosts—men, equipment, tanks who weren’t even real; massive weapons that didn’t exist, battlefields that were nothing but an elaborate mirage.

And in doing so, he had rewritten the fate of nations.

Ryfel exhaled slowly.

Because that’s what Aurex had done.

He hadn’t fought.

He had performed.

He had made Garrik believe he was outnumbered when he wasn’t.

Made him hear footsteps where there were none. Made him swing at reflections, chasing ghosts.

Casper would have smiled at such mastery.

But Ryfel? It clicked in him. He would do more than just admire it.

One day, he would tear it apart.

A warrior’s fire had ignited in him. But not a fire of rage, not of desperation.

This was a cold, calculating fire.

The fire of strategy. Of planning. Of patience.

If he wanted to dominate, to break the rules of this world’s magic, he would need to create something entirely new.

Not just a warrior’s discipline. Not just a mage’s spellcraft.

A fighting style that was crafted from two lifetimes. Something that merged the refined tactics of his old world with the elemental mastery of this one.

Something that didn’t just fight within the rules of magic.

Something that bent, twisted, and shattered them.

Aurex Solmere had dictated the battlefield today.

But ten years from now?

Ryfel Redimir would rewrite it.
