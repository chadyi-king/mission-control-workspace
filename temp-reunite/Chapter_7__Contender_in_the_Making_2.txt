Chapter 7: Contender in the Making Pt. 2

Literally Ten Years Later

‘CRACK! POP! POP!’

Golden confetti rained down as firecrackers burst in the air, filling the Redimir estate’s dining hall with a crackling energy. The warm glow of candlelight flickered across the lavish feast spread across the table, the rich scent of roasted meat and fresh bread lingering in the air.

Elda, Ryker, and Milal cheered in unison.

Ryker:
 "Fifteen years old today! And just in time for the Contender Tournament!"

Elda:
“Don’t stress him out on his special day Ry!”

Milal clapped enthusiastically, practically vibrating in her seat.

Milal:
"Hehehe but ma’am, it actually means it’s finally time for Little Ry to shine!"

Ryfel:
 "I don’t think ‘Little Ry’ fits anymore."

Milal gasped, clutching her chest as if he had just betrayed the very foundation of their bond.

Milal:
 "Blasphemy! Betrayal! After all these years!"

Ryker:
 "She’s right about one thing. You’re ready now." His tone shifted, losing its usual teasing edge. "And that means it’s only right we give you your first true gifts of adulthood."

The room stilled slightly as Ryker pushed his chair back and walked toward a wooden case set aside for this moment.

With a single motion, he flipped open the lid.

The Presents of House Redimir

Inside lay two reinforced gauntlets, polished to a deep metallic sheen, their surface etched with the insignia of House Redimir—the mark of his family, his district, his legacy.

Ryker stepped forward, his voice carrying a rare seriousness.

Ryker:
 "These belong to you now." He lifted them carefully, placing them in front of Ryfel. "From today onward, you will wear them in every trial, every battle. They are not just armor. They are your badge, your strength, and your identity."

He folded his arms.

"From this day forward, you are no longer just Ryfel. You are a Redimir warrior. A Contender."

Ryfel reached out, his fingers brushing against the cool metal.

The weight was solid, grounding. Not heavy in a way that burdened him—but in a way that felt like it belonged.

For a moment, he was lost in thought, absorbing the gravity of the moment.

And then—

Ryker:
 "And, of course, I got you something else too."

Ryfel looked up.

His father reached behind him, pulling out a long, curved object.

A Magic Hoe.

Ryfel (blinking):
 "Wait. A Magic Hoe?"

The words hung in the air for a second too long.

His brain stalled.

Did he… did he just say a Magic Hoe?

His mind betrayed him immediately.

No. No way. No way he means what I think he means. Right?

For a split second, flashes of a very different kind of magic hoe filled his thoughts.

One from his past life.

His posture straightened. His throat dried. His soul left his body just a little bit.

Ryfel (staring at his father, unsure if this was real life):
 "...Am I not fifteen? You got me a Magic Hoe?"

Milal almost fell out of her chair laughing.

Milal (wheezing):
 "PFFFFT—WAIT—OH MY GOD, LOOK AT HIS FACE! HE THOUGHT—"

Elda groaned, rubbing her temples.

Elda:
 "Oh for the love of—Ryker, explain it before his mind gets worse."

Ryker, entirely oblivious to Ryfel’s internal suffering, lifted the hoe proudly.

Ryker (grinning):
 "That’s right! A Magic Hoe!"

Ryfel stared.

Milal was choking on laughter.

Elda was considering walking out of the room.

And then, Ryker continued.

Ryker:
 "This hoe is enchanted to let you dig faster, cultivate the land more efficiently, and even break apart tougher soil with ease! A true Redimir heir should know the value of the land as much as the battlefield!"

Ryfel exhaled slowly.

The relief was immediate, but it was immediately replaced by secondhand embarrassment at his own assumptions.

Ryfel (mentally slapping himself):
 "Of course. A gardening hoe. What else would it be? This world has corrupted me."

He forced a smile, nodding.

Ryfel:
 "Thank you, Father. I will wield both the strength of our house… and, apparently, the power of agriculture."

Milal, who had only just recovered, lost it again.

Milal (cackling):
 "He was really out here thinking Dad got him a brothel pass for his birthday—"

Elda (sharply):
 "Milal."

Ryker, still entirely unaware of the chaos, simply smirked.

Ryker:
 "Good. Then we’ve raised you right."

Ryfel sighed, taking the Magic Hoe and placing it next to his gauntlets.



The celebration continued, but Ryfel’s mind was already elsewhere.

Ten years.

That’s how long it had been since he sat in the stands of the Grand Arena, watching Aurex Solmere dismantle every warrior before him.

The loss of his district had burned into his memory.

The unshakable dominance of the Magic Champion had seared itself into his mind.

The Outer Courts had belonged to them.

But now?

Now, it was his turn to step onto the battlefield.

The last ten years had not been wasted.

He hadn’t just grown stronger. He had studied. He had dissected.

He had broken down the very science of magic itself.

And in the process—

He had forged his own way of fighting. Something born from his past world and sharpened in this one.

Something no one had ever seen before. The tournament awaited.

The world would see what Ryfel Redimir had become.

Ryfel:
“Before the Preliminaries begin, I have to tweak these gauntlets quite abit… But the hoe… Hmmmm I’m not so sure.”

Final Adjustments

The glow of light magic bouncing over an upper room mirror in the wooden workshop behind the estate, tables filled with scattered tools, disassembled parts, and the metallic sheen of Ryfel’s modified gauntlets.

He sat hunched over a sturdy wooden workbench, his fingers deftly tightening a component inside the wrist chamber. The room smelled of polished steel, oil, and freshly scorched earth.

Click. Twist. Adjust.

Every movement was precise, every tweak deliberate.

The Preliminaries would begin in mere hours, and yet here he was—still refining.

He turned his wrist slightly, activating a subtle mechanism inside the gauntlet. A soft hiss of compressed air escaped, the chamber locking into place perfectly.

Good. That should hold.

A voice interrupted the silence.

Ryker:
 "What in the hells… are you doing?"

Ryfel didn’t flinch.

He had felt his father’s presence long before he spoke.

Ryker stood at the entrance of the workshop, arms crossed, his eyes narrowed. His gaze flickered over the modified gauntlets, the shifting weapon, the precise air compression seals Ryfel had just finished adjusting.

It didn’t take a genius to realize—this was not the fighting style of their district.

Farmland warriors did not fight like this.

They threw dirt and boulders. They hid behind walls.

What Ryfel was crafting… was something else entirely.

Ryker took a slow step forward, staring at the gauntlets.

Ryker:
 "Those don’t look like the same ones I gave you."

Ryfel let a small smirk play on his lips.

Ryfel:
 "They’re not."

Ryker:
 "What exactly… did you change?"

Ryfel didn’t answer immediately. Instead, he flexed his wrist, and a hidden blade along the gauntlet’s side snapped into place—sharp, compact, deadly.

Ryker’s brow lifted slightly, but he said nothing.

Then, Ryfel gave his wrist a sharp flick.

A sudden burst of compressed air shot out from his forearm, releasing a shockwave that subtly rattled the workbench.

Ryker’s eyes flickered with something between concern and intrigue.

Ryker:
 "...Huuuuuh."

Ryfel turned toward him fully, meeting his father’s gaze without hesitation.

Ryfel:
 "You’ll see soon enough."

For a long moment, Ryker simply stared at him. Then, slowly, a grin spread across his face.

Ryker:
 "Hehehe. Alright then son."

Without another word, he turned and walked off, leaving only the lingering scent of oil and steel in the air.

Ryfel exhaled, eyes drifting down to his newly refined weapons.

Everything was in place.

Now, it was time to test them.

The Preliminaries awaited.



Redimirs Among Their People

The morning sun bathed the Farmland District in golden light, the air thick with the scent of fresh soil and baked bread. The roads bustled with merchants, farmers, craftsmen, and children playing between the stalls.

At the heart of it all—The House Redimir.

Ryker (laughing, throwing an arm around a passing farmer):
“You old bastard! You still planting straight rows, or are your crops as crooked as your teeth?”

Farmer (grinning, slapping Ryker’s back):
“Straighter than your posture, Lord Redimir! Maybe if you actually farmed once again in your life, you’d know!”

Laughter erupted as Ryker clasped forearms with men, greeted elders with warm bows, and tousled the hair of giggling children.

Everywhere they walked, he was known, he was loved.

Ryfel walked beside him, quietly watching.

People gathered as they passed, and soon, all eyes were on him.

Merchant (grinning as he weighed a sack of grain):
“Ahh, so the boy finally steps into the arena! Like father, like son, eh?”

Farmland Tools Blacksmith (wiping soot from his forehead):
“Aye, but will he hit as hard as his old man?”

Ryker clapped a heavy hand on Ryfel’s back, grinning.

Ryker:
“Hah! Harder, I bet! The kid’s been breaking bricks since he could walk!”

Tavern Keeper (smirking from her doorway):
“Oh, I’d believe that. Look at him—young lord’s got the stance of a fighter already.”

Ryfel (chuckling, shaking his head):
“I wouldn’t say that just yet ma’am. I still have to prove myself.”

Ryker (throwing an arm around him, dramatically gesturing to the crowd):
“Bah! You hear that? That’s humility! Didn’t get that from me!”

The crowd laughed, some shaking their heads.

Elder Woman (smiling as she clutched a basket of herbs):
“It’s good to be proud, but better to be loved. You’ll be both, young lord.”

Ryfel bowed his head respectfully.

Ryfel (warmly):
“Thank you. I’ll fight for all of us.”

This moment—it was familiar.

A campaign trail. A sea of hands reaching for him. Don laughing beside him, slapping his back as he shook hands, smiled, promised them Electorial victory.

Different time. Different world. Same energy.

He exhaled, the warmth of the memory lingering.

Ryfel (smiling, ruffling the boy’s hair):
“I will. That’s a promise.”

The boy beamed and ran off, yelling to his friends about how he had spoken to the future champion.

Milal leaned toward Elda, grinning.

Milal (softly, amused):
“He really does belong to the people, huh?”

Elda (watching Ryfel, eyes soft):
“He always has.”

The cheers, the laughter, the warmth of his people followed them all the way to the tournament grounds.

The Redimir family reached the edge of the tournament grounds, where a large, open-air coliseum had been built to host the Preliminaries.

The crowds had already gathered, eager to see which four contenders would earn the right to represent Farmland District in the Contender Tournament.

Ryfel took a step forward, but Ryker clapped a firm hand on his shoulder.

Ryker (grinning):
“Well, this is it, boy. You ready to make history?”

Ryfel:
“I’ll do what I must.”

Ryker (laughing):
“Bah, always so serious. Just win a few fights and give these people something to cheer about!”

Elda stepped forward, smoothing the collar of Ryfel’s tunic like a mother who refused to accept her son had grown up.

Elda:
“Don’t take unnecessary risks. You’re still young, and no tournament is worth an injury that will last a lifetime.”

Ryfel (smiling softly):
“I’ll be careful, Mother.”

Milal, of course, was far less reserved.

Milal (grinning):
“Ooooh, I’m so excited! Try not to make it too easy for them, Young Master! No one likes a boring fight!”

Ryfel shook his head with a chuckle.

A tournament official in brown robes approached, bowing slightly toward Ryker.

Tournament Official:
“Lord Redimir, we will take care of your son from here.”

Ryker (crossing his arms):
“You’d better. That’s a future champion you’ve got on your hands.”

The official gave a small smile and bowed, then turned to Ryfel.

Tournament Official:
“It’s time. Please proceed inside.”

Ryfel gave one last glance at his family.

Elda:
“Fight well, my boy!”

Ryker (grinning):
“And make sure you win.”

Ryfel nodded, stepping forward, his path set.



The tournament grounds stretched before them, a massive coliseum of packed earth and towering stone walls, carved by generations of warriors who had fought for the honor of their district.

Ryfel stepped through the archway, feeling the familiar sensation of cool shade giving way to open sunlight as he entered the arena.

The crowd was restless, voices murmuring in anticipation. Twenty competitors stood gathered, forming loose groups—some exchanging quiet strategies, others sneering at those they deemed weaker.

At the center, a tournament official stood on a raised platform, scroll in hand.

Tournament Announcer (booming):
“Welcome to the Preliminaries! Twenty of you stand here today, but only four will move forward to represent the Farmland District in the Contender Tournament!”

The murmurs turned into hushed silence.

Tournament Announcer:
“To prove your worth, you will fight in pairs! The lot draw will determine your partners—choose wisely, for your victories will be shared!”

A large wooden box was brought forth, filled with sealed slips of parchment.

One by one, the competitors stepped forward, drawing their partners.

Ryfel waited his turn, stepping forward when called.

His hand dipped into the box, pulling out a single parchment.

He unfolded it.

Bram Ironfoot.

A voice cleared its throat next to him.

Bram (gruffly):
“Guess that makes us partners, huh?”

Ryfel turned to see a lean but well-built young man, slightly shorter than him, with sun-darkened skin and sharp, calculating eyes.

Unlike the other competitors, Bram carried no arrogance. No unnecessary bravado.

Just calm readiness.

Ryfel extended a hand.

Ryfel:
“Looks like it. Ryfel Redimir.”

Bram glanced at the outstretched hand, then clasped it firmly.

Bram:
“Bram. Happy to work with ya!.”

No unnecessary words. Ryfel liked that.

As they released their grip, the next names were called.



Tournament Official:
“Kriscila Glavni and Dain Luthren!”

The crowd stirred.

Dain’s smirk stretched as he turned toward Kriscila, clearly relishing the irony.

Dain (mocking):
“A cruel joke. Someone must have rigged the draw—no way I’d willingly partner with you.”

Kriscila didn’t even look at him, checking the wraps on her gauntlets, adjusting the weight of her chains.

Kriscila (flatly):
“And after all these years, you still need someone better than you to drag you out of messes. Shame.”

Dain’s smirk twitched.

Dain:
“Tch. Don’t get too bold just because you’ve finally built some muscle. If I recall, you could barely hold a sword without trembling.”

Kriscila (raising an eyebrow):
“And if I recall, you could barely hold a conversation without bragging about yourself. Seems like your father never gave you enough praise huh.”

A few competitors snickered nearby.

Dain annoyed, he scoffed.

Dain:
“You’re lucky to even be here, Glavni. Whatever tricks you’re hiding behind that ridiculous chain setup won’t fool me.”

Kriscila finally turned, gaze sharp as a blade.

Kriscila:
“No, I imagine fooling you is quite easy. I just hope your skills are not as bad as your intelligence. Just don’t be a burden to me.”

Dain opened his mouth—only to close it.

His hands clenched, jaw tightening.

Tournament Official (calling out):
“Step forward, contenders!”

Kriscila exhaled slowly, rolling her wrists, letting the chains settle in her grip.

Dain scoffed, but his fists clenched. Getting ready to take the lead.

The gong rang.

The first match of the Preliminaries began.

Dain (smirking):
“Stay out of my way, Glavni. I don’t need help handling a couple of dirt-slingers.”

Kriscila exhaled through her nose, unimpressed.

Their opponents—two burly competitors from lower-ranked Farmland families—had already buried their hands in the ground.

The moment Dain crossed the battlefield’s center—

BOOM.

A thick earthen wall exploded upward, cutting off his charge entirely.

Dain skidded to a stop, scoffing.

Dain (laughing):
“Hah! Such a thin wall? That’s the best you’ve got?”

He reeled back his fist, gathering earth, making it solidified, he slammed straight into the hardened earth.

The wall didn’t even crack.

Dain’s smirk twitched.

Dain:
“Tch—”

Before he could react, a second wall shot up behind him, boxing him in.

And then—the first rock hit.

A boulder the size of his torso crashed straight into his ribs, sending him sprawling onto his back.

The crowd groaned.

Dain coughed, dust filling his lungs as he rolled onto his side, clutching his ribs.

But there was no time to breathe.

A second boulder slammed into his shoulder, knocking him sideways again.

His opponents weren’t just blocking him off.

They were punishing him for being reckless.

Dain (gasping, pushing himself up):
“You—!”

THUD.

Another rock slammed into his gut, forcing the air from his lungs. He collapsed onto one knee, coughing.

And then, the final humiliation. A third boulder struck him in the face.

Dain’s head snapped back, blood dripping from his nose as he crashed onto his back again.

The crowd gasped.

He had been completely overpowered.

The enemy duo smirked behind their defensive formations, preparing to hurl another round of projectiles.

Kriscila rolled her shoulders.

She had seen enough.

Dain wiped the blood from his lip, frustration burning in his chest.

He had charged in headfirst, expecting a quick and brutal victory. Instead, he had been tossed around like a training dummy.

His opponents—two warriors from lower-ranked Farmland families—hadn’t even broken a sweat.

Dain (gritting his teeth):
“Damn lowly bastards—”

CRACK.

A sharp whip-like snap rang through the air as Kriscila’s chains lashed forward.

But instead of striking the wall in front of them, the chains wrapped tightly around her own gauntlets.

The weight settled—and then, her fingers flexed.

Dain barely had time to register what she was doing before—

BOOM.

Kriscila punched forward, her gauntlet-encased fist slamming into the defensive wall. The earth shattered.

Not cracked. Not splintered.

It completely caved in, exploding outward like a house of cards.

The dust settled, revealing two wide-eyed enemies staring at her in disbelief.

Opponent 1 (shocked):
“What—?!”

Before they could even think about countering, Kriscila was already in motion.

Her chains slithered into the ground, disappearing beneath the dirt like burrowing serpents. Her opponent instinctively threw a boulder, expecting her to dodge.

But she didn’t. She caught it. One hand, her gauntlet still wrapped in hardened chains, absorbed the impact.

The crowd gasped. The warrior who had thrown it froze.

Then—Kriscila crushed the rock with her grip, the crumbling debris falling at her feet.

Dain, still catching his breath, stared in stunned silence:
“Since when—?”

The enemies, desperate, moved to create another wall. Their hands dug into the ground, shaping earth— But Kriscila’s chains were already underground.

Before they could solidify their defense, she pulled. The foundation beneath them collapsed. The two warriors stumbled, losing their footing.

Kriscila moved like a storm—fast, efficient, unrelenting. Opponent 1 barely recovered before— She was already in front of him.

One step. A twist of her waist. And then—a brutal, full-force punch to the gut.

BOOM.

The enemy flew backward, coughing blood, collapsing in a heap.

One down.

The second warrior—watching his ally crumple like wet paper—froze.

Dain, finally catching on, moved.

His opponent had completely forgotten about him. With a quick, silent step, he surged forward—And his hardened fist struck clean into the enemy’s jaw.

The warrior collapsed.

The gong rang. The match was over.

Dain stood there, bruised, breathless, and completely stunned.

Kriscila had already retracted her chains, adjusting them like nothing had happened.

She hadn’t even spared him a glance.

The noble girl he had bullied—mocked for her weakness— Had just broken through an entire battlefield like it was nothing. And worse—she didn’t even acknowledge him.

Dain clenched his fists.

For the first time in his life, he realized something terrifying.

He was weak. Weaker than lower ranked nobles, weaker than Kriscila, his stronger bullying days were over.

The crowd roared.

But all Dain could hear was the sound of chains tightening around his ego.

The roar of the crowd was still settling, the echoes of Kriscila and Dain’s match lingering in the air.

Ryfel leaned back slightly, arms resting on his knees as he let the scene replay in his mind.

"Kriscila… I barely recognized her."

Not just because she was physically different—more toned, sharper, confident—but because her entire approach to battle had changed.

She had dominated the fight, controlled the battlefield, made the enemy react to her.

And Dain?

Dain had been a disappointment.

"Arrogant. Predictable. Foolish."

It wasn’t that he was weak—it was that he had no real ability to adapt.

Ryfel sighed, shaking his head.

Bram (grinning, nudging his arm):
 "You saw that, right? The way she smashed through that wall?"

Ryfel glanced at him, smirking slightly.

Ryfel:
 "Hard to miss."

Bram let out a low whistle, shaking his head.

Bram:
 "Man, I don’t know what she was eating these past ten years, but damn. She grew up fine."

Ryfel chuckled, shaking his head.

Ryfel (casually):
 "Hmmm, you are not wrong."

Ryfel left it at that, but internally? "Damn right she did. Hot freaking dam!"

She wasn’t just strong.

The way she moved, the way she carried herself—

It was different now.

There was something about a woman who commanded a battlefield, who broke walls with her fists like it was nothing.

"Yeah. She’s got many somethings." Ryfel thought once again.

Bram, still thinking about her, rubbed his chin.

Bram:
 "You think she’s always been like that? Can’t imagine a noble girl swinging chains around for fun."

Ryfel exhaled, eyes narrowing slightly.

Ryfel:
 "No. She wasn’t always like that."

Bram tilted his head, intrigued.

Bram:
 "Wait… You know her?"

Ryfel (nodding slightly):
 "A long time ago. But only for a short moment. She seemed… quite different back then."

Bram glanced back toward Kriscila, who was standing at the edge of the arena, her expression unreadable as she adjusted her chains.

Bram:
 "Different how?"

Ryfel didn’t answer immediately. He let out a soft chuckle.

Ryfel:
"She used to be bullied. Pushed around by so many. All because she couldn’t use magic properly."

Bram smirked.

Bram:
 "Yeah, no kidding about the change then. If she gets any stronger, I might have to let her win just so she doesn’t beat me into the dirt."

Ryfel chuckled.

Ryfel:
 "Good luck with that."

Bram laughed, then pointed toward Dain, who was still sulking at the other end of the stands.

Bram:
 "And what about him?"

Ryfel followed his gaze, watching as Dain sat stiffly, arms crossed, jaw tight.

There was no satisfaction in his expression.

Only bitterness.

"Tch. He doesn’t even realize he lost before the match started."

Ryfel (casual, but firm):
 "A disappointment."

Bram snorted.

Bram:
 "Damn. Cold."

Ryfel (shrugging):
 "Just honest."

Bram grinned, nudging him again.

Bram (laughing):
 "Alright, then tell me this—who do you think is winning this match?"

Ryfel turned his attention to the fight currently unfolding in the arena.

And just like that, his mind switched gears, ready to analyze again.

Ryfel (laughing):
“What, and let them all pick my brain before the fight? Gotta keep some secrets, Bram.”



But inside Ryfel’s mind, he could already see what was on the battlefield.

“That guy moves too heavy on his back foot. Leaves him open to low sweeps.”

“That one throws too many feints. A real fighter would bulldoze through that hesitation.”

“Sloppy footwork. No control over battlefield positioning.”



Bram chuckled, shaking his head.

Bram:
“Fair enough. Just thought I’d get to know my partner before we start throwing fists.”

Ryfel leaned forward slightly, amused.

Ryfel:
“Yeah? What do you wanna know?”

Bram blinked.

Bram:
“Huh. Didn’t think you’d actually ask that.”

Ryfel smirked, motioning toward the battlefield.

Ryfel:
“Come on, we’ve got time. Ask away.”

Bram rubbed his chin, thinking for a second.

Bram:
“Alright. How good are you, really?”

Ryfel pretended to think, tapping his chin.

Ryfel (grinning):
“Hmm… good enough to be here, I guess.”

Bram snorted.

Bram:
“That’s a half humble half ass answer if I’ve ever heard one!”

Ryfel laughed. Alright, he liked this guy.

Bram (gesturing to the arena):
“Alright, then tell me this—who do you think is winning this match?”

Ryfel looked back at the fight unfolding in front of them.

One fighter was holding back, waiting for the perfect counter. The other was aggressive, constantly throwing heavy attacks.

Bram tilted his head, thinking.

Bram:
“I’d say the guy on defense. He’s forcing the other one to waste energy.”

Ryfel grinned, leaning forward.

Ryfel:
“Good guess. But wrong.”

Bram raised an eyebrow.

Bram:
“Oh? Enlighten me, O wise partner!”

Ryfel laughed, shaking his head. Then, he pointed at the defensive fighter.

Ryfel:
“He’s waiting too much. He’s letting the aggressive guy control the flow of battle. He thinks he’s got the advantage, but all he’s doing is reacting.”

Sure enough, seconds later, the “defensive” fighter tried to counter—only to get caught off guard by an unexpected stance shift.

A single blow sent him crashing into the dirt. The fight was over.

Bram let out a low whistle.

Bram:
“Damn. You called that real fast.”

Ryfel shrugged, still grinning.

Ryfel:
“Lucky guess.”

Bram gave him a side-eye glance.

Bram (laughing):
“Yeah, sure. Lucky. But maybe scary too.”

Ryfel chuckled, but his mind was still running at full speed. “It’s worse than I thought.”

These fighters weren’t just reckless. They lacked the fundamentals of real combat.

If this were his past life—if these were real-world soldiers on a battlefield—

They’d all be dead in minutes.

Ryfel stretched his arms behind his head, completely at ease.



Showtime

The fourth match ended, and the dust in the arena settled.

Only one match remained.

The last two contenders would be decided here.

But instead of looking nervous, Ryfel and Bram?

They were grinning, laughing, and chatting like this was just another day.

Bram stretched his arms, rolling his shoulders with an exaggerated groan.

Bram (grinning):
 "Alright, finally our turn. I was starting to think we’d just get a free pass."

Ryfel leaned back, resting against the stone bench, completely at ease.

Ryfel (smirking):
 "Hey, I wouldn’t mind that. Less work, same result."

Bram laughed, nudging him.

Bram:
 "Nah, I wanna punch someone. Gotta warm up before the real tournament."

The competitors who had already fought—sweaty, bruised, exhausted—stared at them in confusion.

Competitor 1 (whispering, frowning):
 "Why the hell aren’t they nervous?"

Competitor 2 (watching them closely):
 "Do they… not care?"

A few of the fighters looked between each other, unsettled.

A third competitor furrowed his brow, muttering under his breath.

Competitor 3 (realizing):
 "Wait… Ryfel. That’s—"

His words died in his throat.

Eyes widened. A few heads turned.

Competitor 3 (hushed, voice tense):
 "That’s the heir of House Redimir. Lord Redimir’s son."

The murmurs spread like wildfire.

Some warriors tensed immediately, suddenly realizing this match wasn’t just another fight.

They weren’t just fighting another contender.

They were fighting the son of the district’s ruling house.

The highest noble of the Farmlands.

Someone whose name with all its weight attached couldn’t afford to lose.

And yet—

Ryfel was still sitting there, completely at ease, laughing and joking.



Across the stands, Kriscila turned sharply, finally registering his name.

Her violet eyes narrowed, locking onto him.

Across the stands, Kriscila turned sharply, finally registering his name.

"Ryfel Redimir."

Her heartbeat skipped for just a second.

She didn’t know why.

It was just a name. A noble’s name, no different from any other. And yet, something about it—something about him—

She shook the feeling off.

"Focus, Kriscila. What does it matter?"

Her violet eyes flickered toward the arena, watching as Ryfel laughed at something Bram said, completely at ease.

The way he carried himself—relaxed, confident, unreadable.

The boy from years ago. The one who had saved her from being humiliated and beaten down when they were younger.

She had buried the memory deep, focusing on her training, on becoming strong enough to never need saving again.

But now?

Now, he was here. Sitting there, joking with a commoner, like he didn’t have a single worry in the world.

Kriscila (thinking, frowning slightly):
 "Is he really that strong? Or just overconfident?"

She wasn’t sure.

But she would find out, and find out more about Ryfel than anyone in the district in time to come.



Meanwhile, Dain Luthren was having a much stronger reaction.

The moment he heard "Ryfel Redimir," his stomach twisted.

"That name. That damn name."

He remembered it perfectly.

Years ago.

When they were younger, there was only one noble who had ever truly unsettled him.

Not through brute strength—no, Dain had always prided himself on physical power.

Not through mockery—Ryfel had never insulted him the way he had insulted others.

But through something far worse.

Cold, sharp intelligence. A kind of perception that stripped people bare.

Dain remembered feeling it even as a child—the way Ryfel’s eyes seemed to see right through him, like he was nothing more than an equation waiting to be solved.

Dain (thinking):
"That’s the scary asshole from before."

Now, watching Ryfel smirking, joking with Bram, completely at ease, Dain’s hands clenched into fists.

He wanted to see him fail.

He needed to see him fail.

Dain (thinking, scowling):
 "Please let this bastard lose."



A voice cut through the murmurs.

Tournament Official (booming):
 "And now, for our final match!"

The arena fell silent.

The last pairing.

The last contenders to be decided.

Ryfel finally stood, stretching his arms lazily.

Bram (grinning, cracking his knuckles):
 "Time to go make history, partner."

Ryfel chuckled, rolling his shoulders.

Ryfel:
 "Let’s give ‘em a show."

And with that—they stepped forward.



The moment Ryfel and Bram stepped onto the battlefield, their opponents were already tense.

Not because they underestimated them—but because they didn’t know what to expect.

The usual Farmland warriors fought one way—throwing boulders, building defenses, keeping a strong footing.

But these two?

One had gauntlets that looked like they belonged to not just to the farmland district but an advanced blacksmith’s workshop.

The other was wrapped in the normal Farmland gear but 5 times the size, with gauntlets and boots so heavy it looked like he was carrying half a mountain on his limbs.

There was no precedent for how to handle them.

So their opponents stuck to what they knew.



The moment the gong rang, their opponents moved fast.

Both warriors immediately buried their hands in the dirt, drawing up thick walls of earth, the foundation of every Farmland District strategy.

From behind cover, they started launching stones—large, fast, accurate.

A solid, well-practiced formation.

And completely pointless.

Because the moment Bram started walking to them, he didn’t stop.

A rock slammed into his bricked arm. He didn’t flinch.

Another bounced off his , rolling uselessly into the dirt.

One of their opponents gritted his teeth.

Opponent 1 (frustrated):
 "He’s not dodging—keep throwing!"

But Bram wasn’t dodging because he didn’t need to.

He reached the enemy’s wall of solid earth.

And then—

He punched it.

BOOM.

The wall shattered instantly, fragments flying into the air as the enemy behind it staggered back, completely exposed.

Bram didn’t even pause.

His massive fist connected with the fighter’s stomach, sending them crashing into the dirt, rolling across the battlefield.

The first opponent was out.

The crowd roared.

Tournament Announcer:
“Instant Knockout! 10 Seconds from when we rang the gong!”


The second opponent hesitated.

For just a second.

And Ryfel moved.

With a flick of his wrist, a gust of wind shot forward, kicking up a cloud of dust.

His enemy instinctively stepped back from his broken wall, eyes darting around for where Ryfel had gone.

But Ryfel hadn’t disappeared.

He was already behind them.

A swift motion—his hands glowed with gathered light magic.

A blinding flash.

The opponent flinched, trying to cover their eyes—too late.

Ryfel swept a leg out, knocking them off-balance.

He raises a stone pillar smacking their side, sending them upward; Ryfel jolts his brain from a hit to the temple with his fist, knocking him out.

Tournament Announcer:
“Fiv… Fiv… Five Seconds it is finished! What has happened!!!”

The gong rang.

The match was over.

And just like that—Ryfel and Bram had won.



The arena was dead silent.

The crowd, the competitors, the officials—everyone froze.

Even the Tournament Announcer had stumbled over his words, blinking at the unconscious fighter lying limp on the ground.

A wall broken effortlessly.
A fighter knocked unconscious before he could react.
Ryfel and Bram—completely untouched.

The cheers took a moment to start.

Then—the explosion of voices filled the air.

Kriscila had stopped breathing for a second.

She didn’t realize it until she exhaled sharply, her heart pounding against her ribs.

"What was that?"

The battle had been fast. Too fast.

She had seen skilled fighters before.

She had seen strength.

But this?

Ryfel hadn’t just won.

He had dismantled his opponent in an instant, like he had already known the outcome before the fight even began.

Her fingers tightened against her arms, her chains rattling slightly.

Then—her mind pieced together a single thought.

Kriscila (thinking):
"Ryfel. Redimir."

Her breath hitched.

That was him.

The boy who had saved her all those years ago. Now she didn’t just remember only his name, but the feeling from all those years ago.



However, her battle partner had a different feeling.

Dain gritted his teeth.

His nails dug into his palm, his fingers clenched so tightly his knuckles turned white.

Kriscila (pouting):
"This arrogant dick."

Even after all these years, Ryfel hadn’t changed.

That same confidence. That same smirk. That same damn aura like he was three steps ahead of everyone else.

It had made Dain’s stomach twist when they were kids.

And now—it made him sick. He wanted to see Ryfel lose. But after watching this match?

Dain:
"Ugh. No one here is strong enough to beat him."

His jaw tightened.



In the Waiting Zone

The roar of the crowd still echoed faintly outside the stone walls. Ryfel sat on a low bench, arms resting calmly on his knees, watching Bram chomp away on a skewer of grilled meat like nothing happened.

Bram (grinning, mouth full):
 "I can't believe it. Ten seconds! Ten! I thought I crushed it!"

[He holds up both hands, counting on toned fingers.]

Bram:
 "But then you had to come in with your multiple magic skills and fancy footwork, knock him out in five. Seriously, Mr Ry, do you plan to make me look slow?"

Ryfel (chuckled):
 "No, you’re just heavy."

 [Pause.]

 "But reliable."

Bram (mock-offended):
 "Heavy?! You callin' me slow?"

Ryfel (small smirk):
 "I’m calling you the mountain that moves when I need it to."

[Bram crosses his arms, puffing his chest, clearly proud but trying to play it off.]

Bram:
 "Hmph. Fine. Next match, I’m going for five seconds flat OR I will take down two! You better not steal the spotlight again."

Ryfel (chuckling slightly):
 "I’m more worried about you punching the arena in half if you try that."

Bram (grinning wide):
 "No promises."

[They share a lively moment, while the other competitors eye were watching them from across the waiting zone.]

Ryfel (lowering his voice):
 "Listen, Bram. You did great, but next fight—those two won’t break as easily."

[Bram raises a brow, still chewing.]

Bram:
 "I’m listening, Captain."

Ryfel:
 "They’ll expect you to bulldoze. Which means they’ll probably bait you—try to lead you into pits or make you waste your power on decoys."

Bram:
 "Hah! I’d still smash ‘em."

Ryfel (calm but serious):
 "And if they split up and drag the fight long?

They’re used to traditional Farmland matchups. Slow, patient. We broke the pattern."

[Bram’s eyes narrow slightly—Ryfel’s calm confidence grounding the conversation.]

Ryfel:
 "This time, let me disrupt their ground control first. Then you hit harder, cleaner."

Bram (smirking):
 "Alright, alright. We’ll play it your way. But if you grab another five-second knockout, I’m demanding a rematch with you."

Ryfel (grinning slightly):
 "Noted. But I wouldn’t bet on it."



The other six Farmland competitors stood in a tense semi-circle, murmuring sharply.

Competitor 1 (traditionalist, arms crossed):
 "They’re breaking every rule. Farmland fights with walls and patience, not with quick fists and air magic tricks."

Competitor 3 (tense):
 "Tell that to the guy who punched through a fortified wall like it was clay."

Competitor 5 (nervous rookie):
 "How do we even stop that Bram guy? He didn’t even flinch when he got hit."

Competitor 4
 "It’s not just Bram—it’s how Ryfel moves around him. He literally flew when he fought, how do you react to that!?"

Competitor 2
"Hmph they’re showboating. We’ll shut them down in the semis."

Competitor 6 (frowning):
 "If you can even touch them before they knock you out."

Competitor 5:
"I mean he is the Lord’s son… Even I was kinda waiting to see how he turned out. But what was that… 5 seconds!"

Competitor 2
"And that commoner too, hmph, What a reckless fighter, I will see how much he can withstand.”

Competitor 1
"Yes breaking away from our tradition! Disgusting, how can he use equipment five times bigger than normal!”

Competitor 3:
"True… But guys, its not against the rules AND it doesnt even matter, can we actually beat those guys 1 on 1 or 2 on 2?"

Competitor 4
"Ugh I dont think so, I never trained to fight anything like that before."

[All of them nodded, coming to their own realization]

Competitor 6
"I mean… I think all of us are agreeing that fighting them is career suicide right now. If we want to qualify, maybe we should stick together first until everyone else is knocked out?”

Competitor 2
"Yes I agree… Lets take out the other two first then.”

[They all turned, looking towards Kriscila and Dain]



Dain was pacing furiously, arms crossed, while Kriscila sat calmly on a bench, eyes down, fiddling with the binding chains still wrapped around her wrists.

Dain (gritting his teeth, bitter):
 "You’re still thinking about your little hero, aren’t you?"
 [He smirks.]
 "The boy who played savior back then. You really think he’s any different from me?"

[Kriscila’s eyes narrow, but her voice remains cold and level.]

Kriscila (quiet, sharp):
 "No. He’s everything you’re not."

Dain:
 "What, because he stood up for you once?"

Kriscila:
 "No, because he did it without feeling the need to trample someone weaker first."

[Dain’s breath catches—caught between rage and shame.]

Kriscila:
 "You? You were the asshole I needed saving from."

Dain (furious):
"Don’t act like you’re better than me! Without me, you wouldn’t have lasted a day in this tournament!"

Kriscila (turning away, voice flat):
"Absolutely delusional, get your head out your ass. I am not going to be working with a burden."

[Dain's fists tremble as Kriscila calmly leaves him behind, stepping into the hallway leading to the preparation grounds.]



The Prelim Finals

The arena was larger this time, stretched out wide with shallow trenches and rocky outcroppings—like a mock battlefield straight from Farmland’s borderlands. Dust swirled as the announcer’s voice boomed across the coliseum.

Tournament Announcer:
 "This is it! The Farmland District Final Royal Rumble! Five teams, one battlefield! Only the last two teams standing will move on to represent our district!"

The crowd roared, buzzing with excitement as the contenders entered.

Ryfel and Bram stood side by side as the five teams spread out into the arena. They were still laughing and joking around but they were ready. Kriscila & Dain were tense but locked in. But the other three other teams, eyes flickering nervously between the two duos dominating the district chatter.

Bram (grinning):
 "You feel that? They’re looking at us like we’re monsters."

Ryfel (quietly):
 "Let them. The real fight’s starting elsewhere."
 [He nods subtly toward Kriscila & Dain’s corner.]

Bram (brows raising):
 "Huh?"

The three other teams—competitors 1 to 6—had quickly huddled near the far end, glaring toward Kriscila and Dain.

Competitor 1 (gritting teeth):
"Forget Ryfel and the lunkhead for now. Kriscila and Dain are the only other team that could steal the finals from us."

Competitor 3:
"If we don’t take them out now, it’s suicide later!"

Competitor 2:
"Right. We wipe them out first—then we figure out how to deal with the freak team."

They split apart, forming a loose triangle formation, boxing Kriscila and Dain into the far-right sector of the arena.

Bram (grinning wider):
 "Ooooh, poor Dain’s about to get dogpiled."

Ryfel (cold, calculating):
 "They’ve boxed him in like prey. Let’s see how long he lasts."

Bram:
 "And us?"

Ryfel:
 "We wait. Let them make the first mistake."

The gong sounded.
 And instantly, three teams surged toward Kriscila and Dain’s position—earth shifting, dust rising as a wave of coordinated attacks crashed toward them.

Dain (smirking, cocky):
 "Finally. Let’s teach them who runs this field!"

[He charged ahead recklessly, fists covered in earth as he slammed the ground, raising a makeshift wall to intercept one of the rushing fighters.]

Kriscila (under her breath, calm):
 "Idiot! It’s 6 vs 2!"

[Two opponents circled wide, flanking him instantly. A third contender from above sent a barrage of sharp stone shards raining down toward Dain’s blind spot.]

Dain (grinning):
 "Tch—come on then!"

Dodging the first flurry of attacks, he dashed forward. But he overcommitted, trying to brawl all three at once.

Competitor 4 slipped beneath his swing, slamming an elbow into Dain’s exposed ribs.

Dain (grunting):
 "Hah! Weak!"

He twisted to retaliate, but Competitor 5 from behind drove a stone-formed spike into Dain’s shoulder—not piercing, but sharp enough to jolt pain through his arm.

Dain (snarling):
 "Tch—lucky hit!"

Competitor 5:
 "No, you’re just sloppy!"

Before Dain could recover, Competitor 6 vaulted over a wall of earth and kicked him square in the back, sending him sprawling forward into the dirt.

[As the enemies closed in on Dain’s grounded position, Kriscila raised two stone plates, intercepting the follow-up strikes before they could land.]

Dain (coughing, furious):
 "I don’t need your help!"

Kriscila (deadpan):
 "Clearly, you do."

From their distant vantage point, Ryfel and Bram stood calmly as chaos unfolded.

Bram (scratching his head, blinking):
 "Is he… is he seriously trying to fight all six of them alone?"

Ryfel (without blinking):
 "Looks like it."

Bram (smirking):
 "Is he a retard?"

Ryfel (deadpan):
 "Yes. He’s really, really retarded."

Bram (grinning wider):
 "You sure he’s a noble?"

Ryfel (calm):
 "Everyone makes mistakes. His was being born like that."

[They both shared a dry chuckle, watching as Dain got decked into the dirt.]

Bram (grinning):
 "Think we should help him?"

Ryfel:
 "No. I’m learning from him. He’s giving a masterclass in how NOT to lead."

Competitor 4 lunged at Dain, who scrambled back, still clutching his bruised ribs. Before the strike could connect, a stone barrier slid up between them with perfect timing.

Kriscila (calmly):
 "Move."

She kicked him in the gut, flinging him backwards to safety.

[Dain, breath ragged, stumbled out of the way as Kriscila advanced smoothly, eyes cold, feet steady.]

With a flick of her wrist, the ground behind Competitor 4 shifted, causing him to stumble. Kriscila slipped into the opening, sweeping his legs out with a perfectly aimed kick, sending him sprawling.

Competitor 5:
 "Get her!"

Two others charged her flanks.

Kriscila (softly):
 "Too predictable."

She pivoted, raising a compact wall to block the right-hand strike while launching a sharp column of earth from below, catching Competitor 5 in the stomach and knocking him backward into a trench.

Competitor 6 hesitated, realizing the tide had shifted. But it was too late.

Kriscila’s movements were methodical, not flashy. She redirected their momentum, turning their attacks into exposed gaps and overextensions.

Kriscila (thinking):
 "Dain's a distraction. I’ll make sure it stays that way."

She struck again, sweeping her foot along the ground, forcing sharp rocks to jut upward beneath Competitor 6’s feet, throwing him off-balance before delivering a hard palm to his chest, sending him stumbling.



Bram (chewing on a snack he pulled from his belt):
 "Huh. She’s actually carrying that idiot."

Ryfel (watching closely):
 "She’s efficient. Clean footwork. Minimal waste."

Bram (grinning):
 "Bet she’s thinking, ‘Why is this dumbass even here?’"

Ryfel (dryly):
 "No doubt. He’s decoration at this point."

Bram (chuckling):
 "You think they’ll get knocked out before we even move?"

Ryfel:
 "Maybe. But watch—"
 [He nods toward the enemy teams.]
 "They’re figuring it out."

Competitor 1 (gritting teeth):
 "Forget the guy. The girl’s the real danger!"

Competitor 4 (nodding):
 "Yeah, that kid's a punching bag. She’s the one dismantling us."

Competitor 5:
 "We go all in on her. Surround her."

Competitor 6:
 "Then we clean up the other one after."

[The six exchanged sharp glances, silently agreeing. Then, in perfect sync, they began circling Kriscila, forming a noose around her position.]

Kriscila turned sharply, eyes darting as the six opponents closed in, cutting off every escape route.

Competitor 1:
 "You’re done. No room to run."

Kriscila (steady):
 "I don’t run."

But even with her sharp reflexes, the difference in numbers weighed on her.

Competitor 2 launched a heavy earth spike toward her midsection, while Competitor 5 sent a flurry of sharpened rocks toward her head.

Kriscila slid to the side, raising a quick shield—
 But as she blocked, Competitor 6’s low sweep cracked her footing, causing her to stumble.

Competitor 3 was already closing in, fist cocked back—
 The punch slammed against Kriscila’s arm guard, forcing her back.

Bram (raising a brow):
 "Yikes. Now she is the one getting dogpiled."

Ryfel:
 "She can only parry so much before they wear her down."

Bram (grinning):
 "Should we step in?"

Ryfel (thinking):
 "Not yet. Let’s see how far she pushes it."

Bram:
 "Heh. Cold."

Ryfel (calm):
 "Caaaalculated."

Kriscila gritted her teeth as Competitor 4’s punch slipped past her guard, landing square on her shoulder and forcing her back. Her breathing quickened, hair clinging to her forehead as dust swirled around her.

Competitor 1 (smirking):
 "Your partner's useless and you’re surrounded. Just give up already!"

Kriscila’s eyes flicked toward Dain, who was barely standing, still wincing from earlier hits, doing little more than throwing half-hearted punches.

Kriscila (thinking):
 "I’m not losing because of him."

But as she raised another shield to block Competitor 5’s sharp stone strike, Competitor 6 barreled into her side, knocking her down to one knee.

The circle closed tighter.

Bram (cracking his knuckles):
 "Alright, alright. Bet I can take two guys in five seconds, beating you earlier."

Ryfel (grinning faintly):
"Just two? Aim higher."

Bram:
 "Don’t want to steal your thunder."
 [He gathers earth into his equipment.]
 "Five seconds. Two guys. Also could ya do the thing!"

Ryfel stamps the ground, launching Bram across half the arena, dust kicking up as his weighted boots hit the dirt.

Bram (grinning):
 "HEY EVERYONE! I want a turn!"

Competitor 3 turned just in time for Bram to slam a fist into his chest, launching him straight across the field into a stone pillar. Competitor 4 spun to counter, but Bram was already inside his guard, grabbing his arm and swinging him like a sack of potatoes into Competitor 5.

Competitor 1 lunged from behind, raising a jagged stone blade, aiming directly for Kriscila’s exposed back as she deflected two other strikes.

Kriscila (thinking, sharp inhale):
 "Can’t block it!"

The blade came down—
 But a sudden stone wall erupted from the ground, blocking the strike inches from her back.

Kriscila (eyes widening):
 "What—"

Ryfel’s voice came through the dust cloud.

Ryfel (calmly):
 "Its been quite a long time."

The dust cleared just enough for Kriscila to see Ryfel walking toward her, eyes sharp, arms loose.

Ryfel (calmly):
 "Six-on-one’s a bad look."

[He flicked two fingers upward, summoning a gust of wind that scattered the group, forcing them to recoil and break their formation.]

Kriscila (thinking, stunned):
 "Again… Just like back then."

Ryfel (calm, steady):
 "Rest. Let me clean up."

The dust swirled violently as the six attackers scattered, forced to stagger away from Kriscila.

Competitor 2 (panicking):
 "Where’d that wind come from!?"

Ryfel stepped forward, calm as ever.
 His gaze locked on the disoriented fighters.

Ryfel (quiet):
 "You’re done."

Competitor 6 recovered first, launching a jagged spike of earth at Ryfel’s chest.

Ryfel (thinking):
 "Predictable."

[He stepped aside smoothly—barely moving—and the spike buried itself harmlessly into the dirt.]

With a flick of his gauntlet, Ryfel shifted the earth under Competitor 6’s feet, causing them to lurch sideways into the path of Competitor 2’s own incoming attack, taking both out of sync.

Ryfel (to himself):
 "Collapse their formation, isolate them."

Competitor 5 charged Ryfel from the flank, but Ryfel calmly tapped his boot to the dirt, subtly raising a stone plate under the contender’s front foot.

Competitor 5 tripped forward—straight into a waiting uppercut.
 Ryfel’s gauntleted fist connected, sending the fighter crumpling to the ground with a dull thud.

Bram (laughing, stepping in):
 "You’re stealing all the fun!"

[He grabbed Competitor 3 mid-charge and planted him into the dirt face-first with a brutal slam.]

Bram (grinning):
 "Five seconds! Told ya I’d match you!"

Ryfel (coolly):
 "You’re still a second slow."

Bram (chuckling):
 "I can live with that."

Kriscila wiped dust from her face, breathing heavily as she watched Ryfel getting ready to dismantle the remaining fighters.
 Her heart pounded—not from fear, but from the quiet memory surfacing again.

Kriscila (thinking):
 "He’s not just stronger… he’s still controlled. Tactical."
 "Just like when he saved me before..."

With the enemy scattered, Ryfel’s hand darted to his belt, fingers closing around a small, smooth device tucked beneath his gauntlet—one of the strange, unfamiliar tools he’d crafted in secret.

Ryfel (thinking, Marcus mode):
 "Split formation. Perfect."

[He thumbed the pin loose with surgical precision, tossed it in a short arc—the flashbang cracked against the dirt between the clustered fighters.]

Ryfel (calm):
 "Fire in the hole."

The device detonated with a violent flash and a sharp concussive pop, the kind of tactical blast only someone from Marcus' world would recognize.

Competitor 1, 2, and 6 instantly staggered, blinded and disoriented, ears ringing.

Bram (yelping mid-swing):
 "AHHHH! Ry! Friendly fire! Friendly fire! What is that?!"

[He stumbled, blinking rapidly, while still managing to slam Competitor 3 into the dirt by sheer reflex.]

Bram (half-blind):
 "I can't see sh—"

Ryfel (deadpan):
 "That’s on you. Eyes closed next time."

Bram (grumbling):
 "What next time!?!"

With the flashbang still echoing across the arena, Ryfel moved in like a SEALs professional, every step precise.

Competitor 6 stumbled toward him blindly, hands half-raised in confusion.

Ryfel (thinking, calm):
"Disoriented. Lead with a shock to his jaw."

[He drove a sharp elbow into Competitor 6’s jaw, then swept their legs out—sending them sprawling unconscious.]

Competitor 2 tried to recover, rubbing at his eyes while raising an earth barrier to defend.

Ryfel (calmly):
 "Too late."

[He stomped the ground, subtly shifting the earth under the barrier’s base—toppling it into the fighter, pinning him.]

With a single gauntleted punch, Ryfel slammed the grounded barrier deeper, leaving Competitor 2 knocked out cold beneath the rubble.

Competitor 1, barely regaining footing, charged forward blindly, throwing wide swings.

Ryfel (calculating):
 "Wild and blinded. Amateur mistake."

[He sidestepped with minimal effort, letting Competitor 1’s punch swing past. Then, Ryfel grabbed the arm, yanked forward, and delivered a perfectly placed knee into the gut, folding them instantly.]

As Competitor 1 crumpled, Ryfel calmly shoved them aside, stepping back into the clearing dust cloud.

Bram (still squinting, shielding his eyes):
 "Okay—okay, warning next time!"
 [He glances around, noticing the last bodies hitting the ground.]
 "Wait. Did you just finish this without me?"

Ryfel (grinning faintly):
 "You were blinded. I adapted."

Bram:
 "I hate you."

Ryfel (flicks his forehead):
 "Hahaha good. Keeps you motivated."



The arena was frozen in silence for several heartbeats.

Then—
 the crowd erupted.

Farmland elders whispered in disbelief from the noble stands. Farmers and young warriors shouted, clapping, some too shocked to even cheer.

Spectator 1:
 "What was that light?!"

Spectator 2:
 "It wasn’t earth magic! What did he just throw?!"

Spectator 3:
 "They didn’t even land a hit on him!"

Meanwhile, Kriscila pressed her back against the nearest stone column, watching Ryfel step out of the dust cloud—calm, poised, like nothing about this fight had ever been a challenge.

Her heart jumped before she could stop it.

Kriscila (thinking):
 "Why... why does he always do this?"

[Her cheeks warmed slightly, and she scowled at herself.]

Kriscila:
 "Ugh. Seriously? Now?"

She caught herself staring as Ryfel dusted off his gauntlet, that tiny smirk tugging at the corner of his lips.

Kriscila (thinking):
 "Of course he’s smirking. He always looks like he’s already won."

Her grip tightened on her chains as her pulse raced faster.

Kriscila (thinking, frustrated):
 "Idiot. I don’t need saving anymore..."

But watching him from afar, calm as ever while dismantling the field, made the memory of him from years ago flash behind her eyes.
 That day. That same calm.

Kriscila (thinking, quietly admitting to herself):
 "…but it’s still him."



Dain stood off to the side, fists clenched so tightly his nails bit into his palms. His eyes flicked between the cheering crowd and Ryfel casually brushing dust from his sleeve.

Dain (thinking, bitter):
 "Always him."

He could hear the crowd murmuring Ryfel’s name, could feel the shift in the air—they were treating Ryfel like some kind of prodigy, a hero reborn.

Dain (thinking, furious):
 "He steals the spotlight every time."

His gaze shifted to Kriscila, still standing in the clearing dust, quietly staring at Ryfel.

Dain (thinking):
 "And now her, too?!"

His stomach twisted.

Dain (under his breath, jaw clenched):
 "You’re not special, Ryfel."

But even as he tried to convince himself, his pulse hammered in his ears. Deep down, Dain knew what he saw—
The difference between Ryfel’s measured movements, the control, and his own flailing rage earlier.

His glare burned a hole in Ryfel’s back, but Ryfel never even turned to look.



The crowd surged with excitement, mixed with confusion, awe, and whispers of disbelief.

Tournament Announcer (booming):
 "The results are final! Your Farmland District representatives for the upcoming Contender Tournament have been chosen!"


 [Pause.]


"Advancing as your champions: Ryfel Redimir and Bram Ironfoot! Kriscila Glavni and Dain Luthren!"

The crowd roared—but beneath the cheers were hushed conversations, waves of mixed opinions rising like a storm.

Spectator 1 (muttering):
 "That wasn’t normal magic. What did Ryfel even throw?!"

Spectator 2 (awed):
 "He’s Lord Ryker’s son… and already fighting like a seasoned warrior."

Older Farmer (grumbling):
 "Bah, breaking traditions. Farmland fights are supposed to be slow and steady—not flashy tricks and brawling."

Younger Contender (whispering):
 "Still… did you see how he controlled the whole field? That’s not luck."

Spectator 3 (pointing at Bram):
 "And that other brute—Ironfoot’s grandson, right? Carried half the mountain on his hands and feet and still knocked two out cold!"

Spectator 4 (curious):
 "Kriscila too... she handled herself like a champion. That wasn’t luck, that was 100% skill."

Spectator 5 (smirking):
 "Yeah, but Dain? Guy got tossed around."

The murmurs intensified, rippling across the stands like wind through wheat. Above, in the elevated box reserved for the tournament elders, a stern-faced Elder leaned forward slowly, his fingers steepled under a thoughtful frown.

Elder 1:
 "Such unconventional tactics. Effective, but dangerous. What is Redimir teaching his son?"

Elder 2:
"Innovation—or foolishness. Either way, the other districts won't ignore this."

Below, in the crowd, whispers sparked like embers in dry straw.

Spectator 6 (uncertain):
 "Was it some kind of artifact? I’ve never seen magic behave like that before."

Spectator 7 (amazed):
 "Forget the magic—did you see how calmly he moved? Like he knew exactly how it would end."

Two younger spectators whispered excitedly, eyes wide with admiration.

Spectator 8 (awed):
 "Ryfel was incredible, but did you see Bram? That Ironfoot brute fought blind half the time and still crushed them!"

Spectator 9 (laughing):
 "Pure Farmland grit. No magic tricks needed."

Back in the arena, Bram was still blinking, rubbing his eyes irritably.

Bram (with friendly irritation, still squinting):
 "Seriously, Ry? Was making me fight with MAH eyes scarred, part of your brilliant plan, or did you just forget I existed for a second?"

Ryfel glanced at him sideways, a smirk tugging gently at his lips.

Ryfel (dryly amused):
 "If you'd followed the briefing—eyes closed means eyes closed. Not 'stare directly at the explosion.'"

Bram (grumbling sarcastically, shaking dirt from his hair):
 "Yeah, thanks. I'll remember that next time you're throwing flashy magic rocks around without warning."

Ryfel chuckled lightly, eyes scanning the crowd, quietly assessing the mood, the whispers, the ripple of intrigue. As the cheers and murmurs slowly quieted, one of the officials approached the arena floor, motioning for the four selected contenders.

Tournament Official:
 "Ryfel Redimir, Bram Ironfoot, Kriscila Glavni, and Dain Luthren—this way for your official briefing."

They entered a quieter stone chamber, where a trio of solemn-looking tournament elders waited patiently. The official nodded respectfully, stepping aside to let the elders speak.

The eldest among them—grey-haired, dignified, but sharp-eyed—studied Ryfel closely before speaking.

Tournament Elder:
 "Ryfel Redimir, your display just now drew considerable attention. Your methods were... unexpected. Care to elaborate on precisely what technique you employed?"

Ryfel lifted his chin slightly, meeting the elder’s steady gaze evenly.

Ryfel:
 "Just standard elements, elder. Air for the sound, a flash of intensified light refraction—disorientation tactics. Unconventional for Farmland, perhaps, but entirely within tournament rules."

The second elder leaned forward, skeptical.

Second Elder:
 "And yet never taught by any known mentor within our district. How exactly did you come by such techniques?"

Ryfel tilted his head slightly, thoughtfully choosing his words with measured ease.

Ryfel:
 "With respect, elders—the tournament was created to encourage ingenuity and adaptation. Tradition serves us well, but it shouldn't bind our hands when better methods are possible."

The first elder raised an eyebrow, clearly weighing his words carefully, then nodded slowly.

Tournament Elder:
 "Indeed. Regardless, know this: in the Contender Tournament, your every move will be scrutinized by all districts. Consider that carefully."

Ryfel nodded calmly.

Ryfel:
 "I'm counting on it."

The elder regarded the four contenders solemnly, clasping his hands together as he spoke with deliberate clarity.

Tournament Elder:
 "Each of you now carries Farmland’s honor into the Contender Tournament. Listen carefully—your trials ahead will test more than your raw strength. These trials were designed to reveal true leaders, thinkers, and warriors that will lead not just their district but the whole Outer Courts."

Tournament Elder:
 "The first trial is the District Team Fight. You will fight together against teams from other districts. Cooperation, strategy, and trust will decide victory—fail to work together, and you'll fall apart under pressure."

He paused, giving them a meaningful look, his gaze shifting subtly toward Ryfel.

Tournament Elder:
 "The second is the Innovation Trial. Here, ingenuity and creativity reign supreme. Each district must present original, inventive uses of elemental magic—techniques and applications never seen before. Cleverness, not brute force, wins this round."

Bram subtly nudged Ryfel with an elbow, a smirk tugging at his lips. Ryfel ignored him, though a faint smile flickered briefly in response.

The elder continued, unwavering:

Tournament Elder:
 "Third is the Capture the Flag Trial, held deep in the Woods of Minas-Col. You’ll endure challenging terrain, unpredictable threats, and the constant pressure of competing teams.”

Kriscila nodded slightly, her eyes narrowing thoughtfully. She exchanged a quick, meaningful glance with Ryfel—both understanding the complexities of this particular challenge.

The elder took a slow breath, emphasizing the gravity of the final announcement:

Tournament Elder:
 "Finally—the Individual Combat Trial. After all scores are to be added, should you reach this stage, you will stand alone EVEN fighting against your own, testing your personal mastery, courage, and adaptability. Only one can emerge champion, claiming glory for their district and themselves."

His eyes swept across their faces one final time.

Tournament Elder:
 "The tournament begins two weeks from now. Prepare yourselves wisely."

The four stepped out of the chamber, the door closing behind them.

Bram exhaled hard.
 Bram:
 “Woods, inventions, team fights... and a duel at the end. Easy.”

Ryfel:
 “Only if we don’t waste time. Let’s get to work.”

Dain muttered something under his breath and walked off without a word. Kriscila lingered a second longer, her gaze briefly catching Ryfel’s.

Kriscila:
 “Don’t slow me down.”

Ryfel:
 “Wouldn’t dream of it.”

She turned sharply hiding a blush and walked away. Ryfel watched her go for a beat, then glanced at Bram bumping his shoulder.

Ryfel:
 “We start training in 2 days. Early.”

Bram (grinning):
 “Sure, sure. I’ll be half-awake and fully annoyed.”



Back Home

Ryfel stepped back onto the Redimir porch, he could already hear hurried footsteps from inside. Before he could reach for the handle, the door flung open and Milal nearly tripped out.

Milal (excited):
 “He’s back! He’s back!”

From deeper inside, chairs scraped back as Elda rushed out behind her.

Elda (beaming, breathless):
 “Finally! Son!”

She barely waited for him to step inside before throwing her arms around him.

Elda:
 “I’ve been pacing this floor all afternoon!”

Ryfel (grinning faintly):
“Well I wanted you to come to the arena though!”

Elda (playfully swatting his shoulder):
 “And watch so many people and esepcially you get injured? I could never. Hmph.”

From the workshop door, Ryker appeared with dirt-stained hands, grinning from ear to ear.

Ryker:
 “Well? Did you make us proud, my son?”

Ryfel (dropping his gauntlet onto the table with a heavy thud):
 “More than proud. We won!”

Milal gasped and clapped her hands, bouncing lightly on her heels.

Milal:
 “Ahhhhhh He did it! He really did it!”

Elda (laughing warmly):
 “Of course he did! I knew it.”

Ryker crossed the room in a few strides and clasped Ryfel’s shoulder firmly.

Ryker:
 “Tell me everything.”

Ryfel (grinning wider now):
 “Bram Ironfoot and I took the field. Kriscila Glavni and Dain Luthren made it too.”

Ryfel started telling the stories to everyone, piece by piece, he recounted the entire match—the flashbang, the dust cloud, the split-second decisions.

With each beat of the story, the room leaned in closer. Milal gasped at every twist, her hands clasped tightly together. Elda’s eyes flickered between relief and disbelief, laughing at moments then scowling at Ryfel’s risk-taking. Ryker, meanwhile, sat back with arms crossed, grinning and laughing pride.

Elda:
 “The Glavni girl, ooooh she’s sharp. You’ll make a fine team.”

Milal (giggling):
 “Hehehe and more than just a team! How about Bram! He sounds like a walking mountain!”

Ryfel (dryly):
 “He’s exactly that.”

Ryker (laughing heartily):
 “And Luthren kid? Still full of stupid?”

Ryfel (grinning sharper):
 “Tried to charge the battlefield blind. Didn’t end well.”

The entire room burst into laughter. Even Elda, who normally worried over every bruise, leaned into Ryfel’s shoulder proudly.

Elda:
 “Look at you. I can’t decide if you’re a menace or a miracle.”

Ryfel (smirking):
 “Bit of both, depending on who you ask.”

Milal (brightly):
 “I’ll set extra bread at dinner tonight!”

Ryker (grinning at Elda):
 “Break out the good wine. This deserves it.”

Elda (teasing Ryfel as she ruffles his hair and pinching his face):
 “No bruises?”

Ryfel (face stretched):
 “Nommmme at all. I mostly gave it out instead.”

The warmth in the room thickened—the kind of home where love wrapped tighter than any cloak. Even as Ryfel felt the weight of the upcoming trials, for now, there was only family, laughter, and the quiet flicker of pride behind every smile.



What It Means To Win

The lantern’s glow cast soft shadows across the quiet house. Milal was already asleep, curled in a chair by the fire. Elda had retired to bed, leaving only Ryfel and Ryker at the table. The air between them was heavy—not uncomfortable, but loaded.

Ryker took a slow sip from his cup, eyes lingering on Ryfel as if weighing every word.

Ryker:
 “You know what winning the Contender Tournament really means for us?”

Ryfel tilted his head slightly, watching him with quiet interest.

Ryfel:
 “For me? Cause I know I am the best.
 For Farmland? A reputation shift.”

Ryker (smirking faintly):
 “A shift, sure—but it’s bigger than that.”

He leaned forward, resting his arms on the table.

Ryker:
 “When I was a little older than your age, I stood where you did. Made it through every trial. Made it all the way to the champion’s duel.”

Ryfel (quietly surprised):
 “You never told me that.”

Ryker (grinning):
 “Didn’t think I needed to. Back then, it was me versus Aurex. His first tournament—the bastard barely looked like he’d broken a sweat.”

Ryfel’s brow furrowed.

Ryfel:
 “The Champion? Wow you fought him?”

Ryker:
 “Yeah.”

He chuckled dryly.

Ryker:
 “He flattened me in less than five minutes. And the world never let Farmland forget it.”

The room fell silent for a beat.

Ryker:
 “Since then, Farmland’s been boxed into a corner—good for planting crops and raising sturdy folk, sure, but never seen as anything more than the slow-footed underdogs.”

Ryfel (calm, but sharp):
 “Until now. I will change it.”

Ryker (nodding):
 “Exactly. If you win—if Farmland takes the tournament—the council tables change. No more scraping for trade routes or settling for leftovers from the Magic and Transport Districts.”

Ryfel leaned forward now, voice lower.

Ryfel:
 “You’re talking political leverage.”

Ryker (eyes narrowing slightly):
 “More than that. Influence. Our district head would get a direct seat at the high circle—deciding policy alongside the strongest houses. Contender champions tilt the balance, son. Suddenly, our crops matter more than their steel. Our warriors will be recruited beyond the farms.”

Ryfel exhaled, piecing it together.

Ryfel:
 “We stop being the ‘dirt’ under their boots.”

Ryker (grinning wider):
 “We become the boots.”

The silence stretched, filled only by the distant creak of wood and the low hum of wind outside.

Ryfel (thinking aloud):
 “To tell you the truth Father, I always hated it. The moment I saw our district losing the first team match. I really hated it.”

Ryker (firmly):
 “I know… I saw it in your eyes. I was quite shocked, especially because you were 5 years old.”

He leaned back, folding his arms.

Ryker:
 “But as much as I was shocked… I felt proud. Because I felt the exact same way the first time I witnessed how I district fought. How we were constantly underestimated.”

Ryker looked up to the night sky, tearing up a little.

Ryker:
 “You have the same fire in you… Actually no, maybe even way more.”

Ryker:
 “You’re the first in decades with a real shot. If you take this tournament, you’ll make them remember what Redimir blood means. What Farmland truly can be.”

Ryfel:
 “Redimir... and Farmland.”

Ryker’s smirk softened into something more serious.

Ryker:
 “I lost to Aurex because I fought like a farmer. You don’t have that excuse. In fact, sometimes I don’t even know what you have created, but I have been proud of you every single day.”

Ryfel’s gaze flickered toward the window, lost for a moment in the night.

Ryfel:
 “Yea, Fath- No… Dad. I just dont only want to win because of me. But because of all of you.”

Ryker chuckled and reached for the bottle between them, refilling his own cup.

Ryker:
 “Damn right. I know how much potential you have. But I never want to pressure you into this.”

Ryker’s expression sobered.

Ryker:
 “If we lose again, nothing changes. It’s technically fine. We stay the quiet district. The one they trade with out of obligation, not respect.”

Ryfel:
 “Not interested.”

Ryker’s grin returned, slow and knowing.

Ryker:
 “Didn’t think so.”

They sat there in comfortable quiet, staring at the flickering lantern. The weight of Ryfel’s path hung heavy in the air—but under it all, Ryker’s pride was unmistakable.

Ryker (after a long pause):
 “One more thing—when you’re in those trials... I want you to remember, it’s not just about Farmland or our name or even you.”

Ryfel arched a brow.

Ryfel:
 “Then what?”

Ryker (leaning in slightly):
 “It’s about the ones behind you. The ones who’ll never step foot in that arena but depend on who does.”

Ryfel nods, remembering how similar it was to what Don had said about when he ran for the American Presidency a 2nd time.
