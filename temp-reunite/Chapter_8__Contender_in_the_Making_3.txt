Chapter 8: Contender in the Making Pt. 3

Two days later.

The midday sun burned high as Ryfel stood in the quarry’s clearing, where layers of jagged stone gave the terrain an uneven, tactical edge. Bram stretched nearby, rolling his shoulders and cracking his knuckles like he was warming up for a brawl.

Bram:
 “Could’ve let me sleep another hour, y’know.”

Ryfel (checking the terrain):
 “You’d just waste it snoring.”

Bram (grinning):
 “Not wrong.”

Ryfel gestured to the scattered boulders and trenches around them.

Ryfel:
 “Terrain’s half the fight. We train where it’s rough.”

Bram (grumbling as he eyed a steep incline):
 “Or where you can make me fall flat on my face.”

Ryfel (smirking faintly):
 “Adapt or faceplant. That’s your choice.”

They started moving—Ryfel leading drills that blended fast movement, earth manipulation, and coordinated strikes. Bram’s raw strength threw massive chunks of stone into the air while Ryfel weaved smaller, calculated maneuvers—sweeps, traps, and feints—turning the quarry into a living puzzle.

Bram (mid-swing, breathing hard):
 “You’re already thinking about the District Fight, aren’t you?”

Ryfel (dodging behind a ledge):
 “And the Innovation Trial. You’re gonna help test something new tomorrow.”

Bram (wide-eyed):
 “Oh no. What am I testing?”

Ryfel (grinning from cover):
 “Haven’t decided how dangerous it is yet.”

Bram (chuckling as he hoisted a boulder):
 “Sounds about right.”

As training finished, Bram wiped sweat from his brow as Ryfel adjusted one of his gauntlets, already lost in thought about plans for the tournament.

Bram (catching his breath):
 “Think I’ll wander down toward the Glavni side. Haven’t seen Kriscila since the prelims.”

Ryfel (without looking up):
 “Good luck. Don’t get pulled into dumbass/smart girl rival drama.”

Bram (grinning):
 “No promises.”



As Bram rounded the stables near the Glavni estate, he slowed. Voices echoed near the old well, sharp but restrained.

Dain (lowered voice, trying to stay composed):
 “You think standing next to Ryfel makes you untouchable now?”

Kriscila (arms crossed, voice steady):
 “No. It makes me smarter than the ones still pretending this is about pride.”

Dain (gritting his teeth):
 “Farmland isn’t going to change anything. You’re just chasing smoke.”

Kriscila (calm but firm):
 “I’m trying to position my family’s future. You’re still clinging to the ‘noble’ past of your family’s name.”

Dain’s gaze flicked around quickly, noticing Bram, half-shielded behind a wooden post, scratched the back of his neck, frowning.

Bram (thinking):
 “Yeesh. She’s got him cornered and they’re not even fighting.”

Dain:
 “I come from the line of men who went through all the way to the finals! My father and my brothers all had fought hard and well to bring this district glory. Multiple opponents all at one go!”

Ryfel:
 “Well it seems the line has stopped when you were born then.”

Ryfel appears, walking closer to them

Bram (thinking):
 “What the… Since when did he come out of hiding with me?”

Kriscila (blushing):
“Ry-Ryfel! When did you come?”

Dain (furious, stepping forward):
 "Good. You’re here. Maybe you can explain why everyone’s acting like this is your team now."

Ryfel (calm, meeting his glare evenly):
 "Because no one’s stopping me."

Dain (snapping back):
 "You think the Redimirs get to lead just because Ryker had one good run? The Luthrens stood beside your family in that tournament. My bloodline carried Farmland just as far!"

Ryfel (tone cool, but sharp):
 "Your family carried our  bags while he fought Aurex. Try again."

Bram (muttering under his breath):
 "Oof..."

Dain (voice rising, frustrated):
 "You’re no better than me, Redimir! Our names stand equal! My father fought in that same arena!"

Ryfel:
 "Then why do you sound like you’re begging me to believe it?"

Kriscila:
 "He's right. You’re chasing Ryfel like this is still about legacy."

Dain (ignoring her, pointing at Ryfel):
 "No. This is about proving who should lead. Tomorrow. The ridge. You and me."

Ryfel:
 "You’re serious?"

Dain:
 "Winner leads the team into the District Fight. No more debates."

Ryfel (nodding once):
 "Fine. But if you lose, you follow orders—no more tantrums."

Dain:
 "I’ll make sure you don’t get the chance."

He spun on his heel and stormed off, leaving dust in his wake.

Bram (looking at Kriscila, deadpan):
 "I thought today was supposed to be a rest day."

Kriscila:
 "It was. Dain doesn’t believe in those."

Ryfel (already turning to leave):
 "Good. Neither do I."



As Dain stormed off, Bram shifted his stance, rolling his shoulders like he was preparing for a second kind of battle.

Bram (grinning, sidling closer to Kriscila):
 "Y’know... you handle Dain like you’ve been doing it since you were five."

Kriscila (dryly):
 "Since I was four, actually."

Bram (smirking):
 "Could’ve fooled me. That was... impressive."

Kriscila:
 "Thanks."

Bram (gesturing vaguely):
 "Not just both fighting and verbal comebacks—I mean, the way you stood there. Calm. Strong… Hot."

Kriscila (blinking, a beat late):
 "Hot... as in?"

Bram (grinning wider):
 "As in, impressive and—you know—hoooot."

Kriscila:
 "I thought you said impressive already."

Bram (chuckling, scratching the side of his jaw):
 "I did. Just wanted to make sure you heard the other part."

Kriscila (tilting her head, still serious):
 "Right."

Bram (watching her, realizing she's unfazed, but keeping it smooth):
 "You’re a tough one."

Kriscila:
 "I’m a Glavni."

Bram (grinning again):
 "Yeah, I noticed."

Bram (scratching the back of his head, turning to Kriscila):
 "So, uh well... you free after the big duel tomorrow? I know this tavern that serves a darn famous stew thicker than Dain’s skull."

Kriscila (genuine, but missing the hint):
 "We should be focusing on the team dynamic, not food."

Bram (grinning, trying again):
 "Stew helps with tactics, y’know. Builds stamina. I could give you the Ironfoot meal plan."

Kriscila (folding her arms, oblivious):
 "I’ve already adjusted my diet. But thanks."

Bram (muttering, amused):
 "Rigggght. Tactically fasting then?"

He tried to hold her gaze a second longer, testing the waters, but before it could settle into anything more, footsteps crunched softly behind them.

Ryfel (calmly):
 "Bram. You’re losing this duel worse than Dain did."

Bram (turning, flashing a lopsided grin):
 "You could’ve backed me up, you know."

Ryfel:
 "Not as fun."

Kriscila shifted ever so slightly—shoulders relaxing, voice a fraction softer.

Kriscila (straightening slightly):
 "I- I was about to leave."

Kriscila’s gaze lingered on Ryfel, the usual sharpness in her expression softening just enough to betray a flicker of something else—uncertainty, curiosity... or something warmer she wasn’t ready to name.

Bram (confused):
 "Leave? But it’s your own estate?"

Ryfel (grinning faintly):
 "Sure you were."

Kriscila didn’t respond immediately. Her gaze lingered on Ryfel a beat longer than necessary, her usual cool demeanor wavering—just slightly. Something about his calm, confident stance, the quiet authority, made her chest tighten without warning.

Kriscila (recovering, brushing hair behind her ear):
 "So... tomorrow then. Try not to let Dain get under your skin."

Ryfel (calmly):
 "He won’t."

Kriscila (quieter):
 "I… I know."

Bram, watching the shift in Kriscila, raised a brow. He thought ‘Huh. That’s new.’

Bram (confused):
 "Well, we came because we wanted to talk to you about how to form our team together. Buuuut oh wells… Can’t do anything now I guess."

Ryfel (nodding to both of them):
"Yea, get some rest. Tomorrow should be fun."

As Ryfel turned to leave, Kriscila’s gaze lingered on his back for a heartbeat longer than she intended, lips pressing into a faint, conflicted line.

Kriscila (thinking, frustrated):
 "Why does he always look like he’s already won?"



The dirt road crunched beneath their boots as Bram and Ryfel walked side by side, leaving the Glavni courtyard behind. Bram tossed a loose rock ahead of them, kicking it idly with each step.

Bram (grinning):
 "You catch that back there?"

Ryfel (glancing over, calm):
 "Catch what?"

Bram:
 "Kriscila."

Ryfel:
 "What about her?"

Bram (smirking):
 "She went from ‘ice cold punching queen that can smash your head in while demeaning you’ to... I don’t know. ‘Shy damsel who can’t even form sentences around you’ type of girl”

Ryfel’s expression didn’t shift much, but there was a faint twitch at the corner of his mouth.

Bram:
 "Ah ha! You noticed it too."

Ryfel:
 "She’s pragmatic. She knows who’s taking this team forward."

Bram (chuckling):
 "That’s the thing—you’re the only one she doesn’t talk to like she’s going to smack them around."

Ryfel (shrugging his shoulders):
 "Doesn’t mean anything."

Bram (tilting his head, playful but sharp):
 "You sure? She wasn’t that relaxed when I was offering MAH DISTRICT FAMOUS STEW and flattery. Soon as you showed up? Less chains, more... oh its Ryyyy, oh oh I can’t speak weeeelll."

Ryfel almost bursting out laughing, as he scanned the distant farmland stretching toward the horizon and switched back.

Ryfel:
 "It’s not the time for distractions."

Bram (grinning wider):
 "Could’ve fooled me."

Ryfel (smirking faintly):
 "You should focus on keeping up tomorrow. You’re slower when you’re playing matchmaker."

Bram:
 "Hey, it’s not matchmaking if one side doesn’t even know they’re in the ring yet."

Ryfel:
 "Then you’ve got nothing to worry about."

They both chuckled, but as they walked on, Bram side-eyed him once more.

Bram:
 "Just saying—something about her changes when it’s you. Not that you’ll admit it."

Ryfel (quietly, after a pause):
 "We’ve all got our tells."

The Early Morning Duel

The sky was barely turning grey when Ryfel and Bram arrived at the ridge. The rocky outcrop overlooked Farmland’s rolling fields, with a wide, weathered stone bridge crossing a shallow ravine. It was the kind of place old rivals used to settle grudges—and Dain knew it.

Bram hoisted a chunk of stone overhead, sweat already on his brow.

Bram (grunting):
 "He’s not even here yet and you’ve got me lifting boulders like we’re moving a barn."

Ryfel (calm, standing nearby with arms crossed):
 "You’re slower when you’re stiff. Warm up."

Bram:
 "I’m plenty warm. It’s cold logic that’s making me sweat."

Ryfel smirked but didn’t respond, his eyes on the bridge ahead.

Moments later, light footsteps crunched along the ridge path. Kriscila approached, arms folded, chains loosely coiled at her waist.

Kriscila:
 "You two started without me?"

Bram (grinning):
 "Figured you’d still be asleep, considering you ignored my stew invite."

Kriscila:
 "I thought you were joking."

Bram:
 "I wasn’t."

Kriscila:
 "I mean if both of you were eating… I didnt mind coming."

Her gaze shifted to Ryfel, and for a second, her tone lost its edge.

Kriscila:
 "Yo-You’re really doing this?"

Ryfel:
 "Dain asked for it."

Kriscila:
 "He’s baiting you."

Ryfel:
 "He thinks this is about pride. It’s not."

Kriscila:
 "Then what is it?"

Ryfel:
 "Control."

Kriscila stared at him quietly, but something in her eyes softened, like she understood more than she was willing to say.

Bram (breaking the tension):
 "You two done talking like this is a tournament match?"

Kriscila (to Bram):
 "It seems to Ryfel, it always is."

Bram (joking):
 "Oooh well it seems like you know him very well already huh!"

As the morning light sharpened across the ridge, the sound of footsteps echoed from the far end of the bridge.

Dain had arrived—cloak slung over his shoulder, eyes locked on Ryfel with the kind of heat that didn’t belong in the early cold.

Dain (calling out):
 "Redimir! Ready to finally settle this?"

Ryfel (calmly, not moving yet):
 "Let’s."

Dain:
 "One round. Winner calls the shots for this team."

Ryfel (stepping forward, voice calm):
 "Fine by me."

Bram and Kriscila stayed just off the bridge, observing. Bram leaned on a low boulder, eyes sharp.

Bram (muttering):
 "Want odds?"

Kriscila (without looking at him):
 "I’m not betting against Ryfel."

The wind swept through the ravine below as Ryfel approached the center of the bridge, stopping at the worn marks left by countless past duels.

Dain:
 "You’re not walking out of this bridge thinking you lead me."

Ryfel (adjusting a gauntlet):
 "I already do."

Before Dain could snap back, he lunged.

Dain (gritting his teeth):
 "Let’s see you say that after I break your ribs!"

Dain’s fist shot forward, earth magic rippling beneath his feet—boosting him into a lunging strike. Ryfel shifted sideways, calm as ever, letting Dain’s gauntlet graze past him.

Ryfel (quietly):
 "Predictable."

Without missing a beat, Ryfel stomped, sending a sharp ripple through the bridge’s surface. The stone buckled just enough to throw off Dain’s footing mid-swing.

Dain recovered quickly, dropping low and slamming both fists into the bridge, sending a line of jagged stone spikes toward Ryfel.

Ryfel:
 "You keep fighting the ground. I fight the person."

With a swift sidestep and palm strike, Ryfel slammed Dain’s shoulder off-angle, forcing him into a stumble. Dain roared and swung wide again, launching a burst of earthen shards in Ryfel’s direction, but Ryfel ducked low, rolled beneath them, and dashed forward.

In an instant, Ryfel’s gauntlet connected cleanly with Dain’s face—controlled but firm.

Dain (staggering back, winded):
 "You little shit!"

Ryfel (grinning faintly):
 "My dude, you're swinging like you're at the village carnival."

The duel had barely begun, but Dain’s cheek was already reddened from a glancing gauntlet strike. Ryfel stood centered, steady, like he hadn't even warmed up yet.

Dain lunged again, only for Ryfel to step aside and slapping the back of Dain’s head, snapping his neck forward.

Ryfel:
 "One."

Dain spun, snarling.

Dain:
 "You’re gonna need more than that."

He charged low, fists crackling with earth magic. Ryfel ducked beneath the swing and clipped Dain’s ribs with a sharp jab.

Ryfel:
 "Two."

Dain staggered but bit down a grin.

Dain:
 "You counting now?"

Ryfel:
 "Why are you growling like a dog?"

Dain came again, channeling stone beneath his feet to propel himself upward. Ryfel shifted left, palm-striking Dain’s shoulder mid-air and sending him tumbling into a half-collapsed pillar.

Ryfel:
 "Three."

Bram (muttering with wide eyes):
 "He’s tapping him like it’s game, but Dain’s getting wrecked."

Dain pushed off the broken stone, blood running from a scrape on his brow—but his grin only widened.

Dain (howling):
 "What’s wrong? You afraid to go all out?"

Ryfel (calmly, stepping in closer):
 "If I did, you wouldn’t be standing."

Dain roared and lashed out with a wild haymaker, but Ryfel dipped under and landed a clean punch to Dain’s gut.

Ryfel:
 "Four."

Dain gasped but chuckled through the winded breath.

Dain (gritting his teeth):
 "You think this hurts me?"

Kriscila (watching intently, quiet):
 "He’s taking damage just to prove something."

Ryfel stepped back, circling like a predator.

Ryfel:
 "Yeah. You’re stubborn, but not smart. So why though?"

Dain wiped blood from his lip again, standing straighter.

Dain (grinning wildly):
 "Because I have been trained this way. Stubborn wins fights."

Ryfel:
 "Not this one. You can’t even lead yourself, but you want to lead us?"

Ryfel’s words, just like his hits started cutting deep into Dain’s spirit. Dain’s wild swings were slowing and his manic grin slowly faded. Blood dripped from the corner of his mouth as he stumbled, then lunged forward again.

Dain (panting, eyes wild):
 "Yes I’ll be the leader! I’m the rightful one—this will be my team!"

Ryfel sidestepped the sluggish blow and struck Dain’s ribs with a clean, sharp jab that sent him reeling.

Ryfel (thinking):
 "He should be down by now… why is he still moving like this?"

Dain wiped the blood off with the back of his hand, grinning through swollen lips.

Dain:
"You’ll never be more than MY stepping stone, Redimir! My family—my father—he promised this was ours!"

Ryfel’s gaze narrowed.
 Bram and Kriscila, watching from the edge of the ridge, exchanged glances.

Bram (quietly):
 "Is… is he alright?"

Kriscila (frowning):
 "No. He’s bloody delusional. He has been since he bullied me from young."

Dain surged forward again, hurling chunks of earth blindly at Ryfel, shouting over the storm of dust.

Dain:
 "I am a Luthren! I was born to be Farmland’s champion!"

Ryfel didn’t even flinch. He weaved between the flying debris, calm as ever.

Ryfel (thinking, disturbed):
 "I have seen this before… It’s like he’s fighting a ghost. Not me."

Dain charged once more, wild and reckless, but Ryfel snapped his gauntlet outward—earth magic compressing the bridge stones beneath Dain’s boots, locking them mid-stride. His legs sank waist-deep into hardened rock.

Dain (thrashing):
 "No! NO!"

Ryfel (stepping close, calm but with rising irritation):
 "You’re trapped. This is done."

Dain (desperate):
 "You can’t stop me! I’ll never give in! My family trained me for this—they MADE me ready!"

Ryfel:
 "Trained you how? To get beaten until you believe it means you’re strong?"

Without waiting, Ryfel drove a gauntleted fist clean into Dain’s jaw.

Dain (slurring through a busted lip):
 "I... I’m better than you...!"

Ryfel:
 "No. You’re broken."

Ryfel’s strikes came sharp, controlled—not to cripple, but to strip Dain’s false armor away.
 A hook to the ribs.
 A short punch across the face.
 A palm strike to the solar plexus.

Ryfel (quiet, cold):
 "Why are you like this?"

Dain (desperate):
 "I’ll lead this team! I’m the one! I was born for this!"

Ryfel slammed a punch into Dain’s stomach. The air rushed out of Dain’s lungs, but still, his eyes burned with madness.

Dain:
 "My father told me—I’m destined to lead! I’m the Luthren heir!"


 [He struck him again, snapping Dain’s head sideways.]

Dain (spitting blood, voice cracking):
 "I’m the one! I’m supposed to bring Farmland glory! I’m the one they trained for this!"


 [Another punch to Dain’s ribs, clean and brutal.]

Bram (shouting from the sidelines):
 "Dain! Stop this, man! What’s wrong with you?!"

Dain (screaming):
 "I AM THE LEADER! I AM—"

Ryfel (cutting him off with a sharp strike):
 "You’re nothing like a leader."

Dain (coughing hard, eyes wild):
 "You don’t get it! I HAVE TO WIN! I HAVE TO!"

Ryfel (slamming a palm into Dain’s chest):
 "Why?! WHY DO YOU HAVE TO?!"

Dain (choking on breath, stubborn):
 "Because... because if I don’t, I’m nothing!"

Ryfel (cold stare):
 "Wrong answer."
 [Backhand across the face.]

Dain (pleading through gritted teeth):
 "Because they said I’m the only one! The only one who can do it! The Luthrens deserve this!"

Ryfel (low, frustrated):
 "Wake up."
 [He punches him in the ribs again.]

Dain (shouting louder, fraying):
 "I AM THE ONE WHO’S SUPPOSED TO LEAD! I AM THE ONE! I AM—"

Ryfel (cutting through the words, furious now):
 "STOP IT!"
 [He drives his gauntlet into Dain’s collarbone.]

Kriscila (shouting):
 "Dain, listen! You’re delusional!"

Bram (quiet, shaken):
 "He’s lost it..."

Dain (tears now threatening to break free, still forcing the words out):
 "I HAVE TO LEAD! I HAVE TO! THEY SAID IT’S ME! IT HAS TO BE ME!"

Ryfel (grabbing Dain by the collar, inches from his face):
 "What happens if it’s NOT you?!"

Dain (desperation pouring out):
 "Then I’m nothing! I don’t know who I am if I’m not the one leading!"

Each hit started to reveal not just his ego but something more.

His clothes, already tattered from the earlier fights, ripped further under the force of Ryfel’s attacks, exposing more than just his bruised skin.

For a moment, no one said anything. The air hung thick with tension as Dain’s back was exposed, and the others could see the damage—not from Ryfel’s blows, but from years of hideous abuse that had scarred him long before this duel.

Bram (shocked, voice low):
 "What the hell...?"

Kriscila (staring in disbelief):
 "He... has scars everywhere."

Across Dain’s shoulders and back were deep, gouging marks—old wounds that had long since healed, but left behind twisted patches of flesh, scarred and disfigured, as if he had been punished relentlessly by hands that should’ve cared for him. Some were laced with a dark purple hue, remnants of strikes and beatings that had no place on a child. Others were more faded, like the scars of a lifetime of cruel, relentless conditioning.

Bram (shaken, his voice barely audible):
 "How could they do this to him?"

Dain (spitting blood, delirious):
 "I... I was supposed to lead. My brothers—my father—they said I’m the only one worthy..."

The air seemed to grow still, the harsh wind of the ridge cutting through the silence. Ryfel, still standing above Dain, lowered his fist slightly. His expression softened for a moment, but only just—there was no pity in him, but there was understanding.

Ryfel (voice quieter, with a sharp edge):
 "You weren’t born to be their hope, you were violated for their sick twisted ideals."

Dain’s shoulders shook, his entire body trembling now, and for the first time, his gaze faltered. The pride that had driven him—the relentless need to prove himself, the delusion of superiority—he cracked.

Dain (in a broken whisper, tears streaming down):
 "I was supposed to be... the one..."

Ryfel:
"Dain… You’ve lived your whole life under their shadow, believing you had to be something you were never meant to be. But none of that was real. You’ve been suffocated by their expectations, but now I will give you the chance to truly breathe again."

Ryfel loosened the earth around Dain’s chest, as he completely started to break down in tears. Dain’s vision blurred for a moment, his body weak and battered, yet his eyes locked onto Ryfel. And for the first time, he saw something else in Ryfel’s eyes—a clarity, a strength that seemed to glow from within him, almost blinding.

Ryfel (looking down, voice still steady but softer):
"You’re not a pawn, Dain. You never were. You’re a person. And you’re free to decide what you do with that."

In this moment, Ryfel reached out his hand towards Dain.  It wasn’t just Ryfel standing there, but he became an embodiment of the freedom Dain had been denied his entire life.

Dain (his voice breaking, a hint of awe):
 "How... how did you do this?"

Ryfel:
 "I came from a time where freedom was everything in our land. You are the one did this. You’ve always had the choice, Dain. You just couldn’t see it until now."

Dain (his voice faltering, defeated):
 "I... I don’t know what I am anymore... What am I supposed to be? I’ve been told... all my life... that I had to be the leader... that I had to carry this legacy... but I can’t... I don’t know what I’m supposed to do anymore."

There was no anger in his voice anymore. No defiance. Just exhaustion. Dain’s entire existence had been forged in the image of a role that didn’t belong to him.

Ryfel (gently, finally breaking the silence):
 "You’re supposed to be you, Dain. That’s all you’ve ever needed to be. Stop trying to fill their shoes."

Dain (softly, breaking completely, whispering):
 "I… I just want to be good enough…"

For the first time, Dain let the tears flow freely. The floodgates opened, and the weight of years of pain, pride, and shame came crashing down on him all at once. He wasn’t just broken physically—he was shattered on the inside.



The Aftermath

The wind rolled across the ridge as the dust from the fight finally settled. Ryfel stood in calm silence, Kriscila leaning against a nearby rock, and Dain sat off to the side, wiping blood from his face, head hung low.

The air was heavy. Too heavy.

Bram (breaking the tension, arms crossed):
 "So... this is the part where we all pretend that wasn’t a disaster, or...?"

No one answered him.

Bram (shrugging):
 "Right, perfect. Silence and brooding. Great team-building exercise."

Kriscila (deadpan, without looking at him):
 "Bram."

Bram (grinning, pushing on):
 "No really—Ryfel’s out here breaking backs, Dain’s fighting ghosts, and you’re standing there like you’d rather chain us all to a wall. You’d think we were prepping for a funeral, not a tournament."

Ryfel’s eyes flicked toward him, amused.

Ryfel (chuckling):
 "Well, noone died but I’d say that was quite interesting."

Bram (grinning wider):
 "Just about. Unless one of you plans to, I don’t know—say we should probably start figuring out how not to get wiped in the District Fight?"

Kriscila sighed, finally uncrossing her arms.

Kriscila:
 "He’s not wrong."

Dain stayed quiet, still staring at the ground, but his hands were clenched tight.

Bram:
 "So? Are we doing this? Or am I carrying this team on charm alone?"

Ryfel:
 "We’re doing this."

Bram (pointing at Kriscila and Ryfel):
 "I know who I would choose and to me, you two have been dancing around as my choice about who should be leading the team."

Kriscila:
 "There’s no dance. He won."

Bram (nodding):
 "Yeah. That’s the point. Look, no offense to Dain—"
 [He glances at Dain sitting silently nearby.]
 "—but Ryfel’s the only one thinking three moves ahead here."

Kriscila (after a pause):
 "He’s right."

Bram claps once, breaking the tension further.

Bram:
 "So can we stop pretending there’s some democratic process happening here and just say it?"

Kriscila (reluctantly but firmly):
 "Ryfel leads."

Bram:
 "Thank you. Finaaaaally. This awkward energy was killing me."

Ryfel simply nodded once, saying nothing, but Kriscila noticed the faint twitch of approval behind his usual composure.

Before anyone could reply, Dain stood up from the stone he’d been sitting on. His body was battered, eyes hollow but determined. He stepped toward them, fists clenched but not raised.

Bram (half-joking, bracing):
 "Please tell me you’re not about to challenge him again, Dain."

Dain (quiet, voice strained but clear):
 "No."

They all turned to him, tension rising.

Dain:
 "I... I’m done fighting him. I lost."

His eyes flicked toward Ryfel.

Dain:
 "But if you’re going to lead, I need to learn how you fight."

Kriscila arched a brow, surprised.

Kriscila:
 "You’re asking him to teach you?"

Dain (swallowing hard):
 "Yeah. If you’re serious about leading this team... then show me how to stop holding myself back."

The silence that followed was heavier than before—but this time, it was different. It felt like things could finally move forward.

Bram (grinning faintly):
 "Well, look at that. Maybe there’s hope for us yet."

Ryfel:
 "Unexpected but highly welcomed. Well then, first rule of business, I just need to know two things, how y'all fight and how we can improve that. I will take care of all the planning for every trial. And we start first thing tomorrow."

Ryfel looks over at Dain

Ryfel:
 "But for you, Dain, just take some time off and rest.”



Old and the New

The air was thick with the scent of metal and oil as the team walked into the small but well-equipped workshop hidden beneath one of Farmland’s older buildings. Ryfel moved with a purpose, gesturing for the others to follow him.

The walls were lined with tools, modified gear, and stacks of plans scattered across the workbenches. In one corner stood a sturdy wooden training dummy, the target areas reinforced with steel plating.

Ryfel (gesturing to the workshop):
 "This is where we prepare for more than just brute force. Let’s talk about how we fight, and where you each fall short."

Kriscila (crossing her arms, steady):
 "I assume you’ll be pointing out my weaknesses."

Ryfel (not missing a beat):
 "That’s why we’re here. Your control is exceptional, but you lack unpredictability. You fight with your chains that seem to go one way fast. It’s clean, it’s sharp—but too readable. Your opponents will catch on fast."

Kriscila tilted her head slightly, acknowledging his point.

Ryfel:
 "You rely on chains, but they’re not as versatile as they could be. We can amplify that—use them for more than binding. I’ll work on tools that let you channel your elemental magic through the chains, turning them into weapons of disruption and mobility, not just containment."

Kriscila didn’t speak immediately, her eyes narrowing as she processed Ryfel’s suggestion. Her fingers brushed the chains coiled at her side, but she said nothing. She was used to being methodical, but the idea of adapting her weapon felt new.

Bram (chuckling, arms folded):
 "What the hell… You can make those chains more dangerous?"

Ryfel (nodding):
 "Absolutely. If we adapt your movements, you can use the chains to block, attack, and disorient—all at once. Even fly, because you’re not just using force—you’re manipulating the field."

Kriscila gave a subtle nod, eyes flickering toward the workbench.

Ryfel turned his attention back to Bram, who was leaning against a wall, arms still crossed, but now fully focused on the conversation at hand. The weight of the training had left its mark on his toned body.

Bram (grinning, nudging his shoulders):
 "So, what’s the verdict? Am I still a walking mountain in your eyes?"

Ryfel (studying him with a calculating gaze):
 "You’ve got potential—more than just power."

Bram raised an eyebrow, intrigued.

Bram (laughing lightly):
 "Is that so?"

Ryfel (nodding, tone firm):
 "You’ve got a trick up your giant ass sleeve, don’t you?"

Bram blinked, his grin faltering for a second.

Bram (taken aback, keeping his cool):
 "What do you mean?"

Ryfel stepped forward, eyes narrowing slightly as he assessed Bram’s stance—he knew. Bram wasn’t just about power. There was more to him.

Ryfel (pointing directly at Bram’s limbs):
"When you fight, you hold back. But it’s not because you’re weak—it’s because you’ve been trained to contain that brawn with a huge earth burden. 

I truuuuly wonder what happens when you take off your equipment? Hmmmm?”

Bram (eyes widening, shocked):
"Wait—how did you...? My grandpa says I shouldn’t… I mean, I don’t know what you are talking about!"

Bram wanted to continue to respond but stopped himself. His fists clenched as he processed what Ryfel had just implied. No one had ever called him out on that before.

Bram (serious, quieter now):
 "Yeah, well... it’s a bit of a... secret."

Ryfel (nodding slowly):
 "I get it. But right now, we need you to focus on Mountain Bram, but a mountain that can move. We make you heavier—add more mass—then your base strength and defense will be unmatched.

We'll refine your ability to absorb hits, crush anything in your path, all while roaming the battlefield.

We’ll add weight—metal, earth—to slow you down at first, yes. But your advantage will be that nothing can stop you once you hit them."

Bram’s eyes lit up with excitement now, finally understanding the full scope of what Ryfel was offering. This wasn’t just about raw strength anymore—it was about harnessing that power in a new way, turning it into something unstoppable.

Bram (grinning wide):
 "Now that’s something I can get behind. Let’s break some bones."

Ryfel (smiling, but still serious):
 "One step at a time. First, we make you fully covered. The rest will come when you learn control."



From Dain’s Perspective

Over the next few days, the team trained with a single, unyielding purpose: to be stronger than they ever thought possible. Ryfel, ever the tactician, drilled them individually. 

They learned that their strengths and weaknesses weren’t just parts of a group—they were part of themselves. And as they pushed their bodies and minds, they became not a team, but individual monsters.

Dain finally joined as he walked towards the field that held the Redimir workshop.

The rest of the team was gathered, testing out their fresh equipment and tactics. The air hummed with a faint smoke from all the new gear and tech lying around.

But as Ryfel set them up for their training demo, things started to look… a little more ridiculous than Dain had anticipated.

First, Kriscila stood afloat in the centre of the field, her chains now not just one for each arm, but too many to count from afar. She was hovering and whipping around her with an almost unnatural grace. 

She twisted, spun, and flicked them like a master puppeteer. Every chain moved as if it had a mind of its own, wrapping around training dummies and pulling them into the air—Kriscila herself floating in place, her feet barely skimming the ground.

Dain (eyes wide, muttering to himself):
 "What the hell is this?"

Bram, meanwhile, was not exactly floating. In fact, he was immobile—but he was a force to be reckoned with nonetheless. 

He had somehow crafted a massive boulder suit for himself, now encased in thick metal and stone armor with large jagged spikes protruding from the shoulders, forearms, and knees. Every new piece looking like it belonged in a battlefield fortress rather than on a human.

Bram (grinning, unable to move gracefully):
 "You know, I might’ve overdone it with the weight, but this thing’s sturdy!"

Bram suddenly shuffled his entire body moving as if on a slippery surface. The flattened rock shifted underneath him, his movements were slow and ridiculous

Bram (grinning, with his head popped out from his fortress armor):
You know, I never thought I'd be this slow in battle, but I guess there's a first for everything."

Dain (staring, completely baffled):
 "What the hell? Is this a joke?"

Kriscila (without even breaking a sweat, still floating effortlessly):
 "This isn’t a joke. You’d better get used to it. We’re not here for show."

Bram (still trying to move with some dignity in his giant rock suit):
 "It’s a work in progress, alright? I’ll get the hang of it. I just need to work on my footwork."

Dain blinked. He looked from Kriscila, who was now floating while controlling multiple chains in perfect synchronization, to Bram, who was basically an immovable rock wall.

Dain (confused and frustrated):
 "This is... this is real?

Dain (looking back and forth, genuinely bewildered):
 "And this... thing on Bram?!"

Ryfel (watching the chaos unfold with a raised eyebrow, but calm):
 "It’s a work in progress. But I think you’re starting to see the difference. This is what you’re going to be up against."

Dain (eyes narrowed, frustration mounting):
 "So this is what we’re becoming? Just a bunch of crazy machinations?"

Ryfel (shrugging slightly, voice cool and tactical):
 "Not just tech. It is Tactics. This is about efficiency. You can’t just rely on brute force anymore, Dain. You need to think like we do—adapt and survive."

Dain (gritting his teeth, still not fully grasping the scope):
 "I’m supposed to fight like them? What am I supposed to do—fling chains around and wear a rock suit?"

Bram (chuckling, testing his arm strength in the rock suit):
 "Hell yeah! If you’re strong enough to move in it. Otherwise, you’ll just be a boulder rolling downhill."

Ryfel (looking at Dain with a glimmer of realization):
 "You’ll have to find your own path. But we all start by adapting to what we have. No shortcuts. We’re not all made for the same fight."

Dain (shaking his head, a little more lost than before):
 "I don't get it… I can’t even figure out how they fight like that. How am I supposed to do what they are doing?"

Ryfel:
 "You’re missing the point, Dain. This isn’t about changing who you are—it’s about making you the best version of yourself. The version that doesn’t get caught in the same trap again."

Dain faltered. The words hit deeper than he was prepared for. He had always been told what he was supposed to be, what his family expected. He had never been allowed to decide for himself.

Ryfel:
 "I’m telling you this because I’ve seen it before. I’ve seen men like you—men who take the hits and think that’s strength. It’s not. Strength comes from knowing when to fight, knowing when to move, and knowing when to hit back harder than your opponent expects."

Dain (swallowing hard, unsure):
 "But… how do I change that? How can I fight differently?"

Ryfel (eyes narrowing):

"You don’t need to change who you are—you’re a fighter, Dain. That’s the foundation. What you need to change is how you fight. Stop fighting for your family’s approval. Fight because you want to prove that you can win, for you."

Dain (quietly, voice cracking just slightly):
 "You think I can do that? Fight for myself... after all this?"

Ryfel:
“Yes, I will show it to you, without changing who you are but actually maybe even double down on it.”

There was a long pause, the weight of Ryfel’s words settling over Dain. The other two watched in silence, sensing the shift in the air. Kriscila’s eyes narrowed slightly, as if understanding the depth of Ryfel’s impact.

Bram:
 "He's right, man. You gotta let it go, and by let it go, I mean, go absolutely ham."

Dain looked down at his hands, the weight of what Ryfel had said sinking in. But Bram’s words snapped him out of it to confuse him.

Dain (quietly, almost to himself):
 "Alright. I’ll try. I will try to go ha-??? Huuuh?"

Ryfel chuckled, a slight, approving smirk on his face.

Ryfel:
 "Let me show you what we came up with."



Boombayah

Ryfel walked into the workshop, coming out with a set of customized armor—heavy yet flexible, lined with metal reinforcements and earth enhancements.

Dain eyed it curiously, still not fully sure what was coming next.

Dain (looking over the armor):
 "This... this is for me?"

Ryfel (smirking, holding up a small metal trigger):
 "You’ve always charged in headfirst. You’re not changing that. You’re doubling down."

Dain furrowed his brow.

Dain:
 "I thought you said I needed to fight smarter."

Ryfel (grinning slightly):
 "Smarter doesn’t mean slower. It means knowing when to hit hard—and how. So here’s your edge: armor that won’t stop you from diving in, but makes sure no one wants to be standing when you arrive."

Dain stepped forward, inspecting the armor closely. It was heavy, definitely, but designed to absorb impacts and various contraptions. The gauntlets and chestplate were thick, reinforced with earth and metal to hold off the heaviest blows.

Ryfel:
“With your style of fighting, you’ll take hits—but you’ll use them to make them feel the pain right back. You close the distance even though you get hit, and once you’re close enough, you release it. The armor will burst itself forth, using earth and wind magic that you will train in further.”

Bram (shouting across the field):
 "Time to see if this suit and you work!"

Dain (reacting instantly, stepping forward):
 "Let’s test it."



For the rest of the day, the group trained relentlessly. Bram, Kriscila, Dain, and Ryfel worked in tandem, pushing their limits.

By the end of the day, all of them were covered in sweat, their bodies bruised but ready—a team but not really a team, they were forged instead in individual strength.

Ryfel (looking at the group, voice steady):
 "We’re done for today. Rest up. We have a week left to prepare for the trials."



The Final Day before the Tournament.

The team trudged through the doors of the Redimir estate, their bodies tired and sore from a grueling day of training. Bram was dragging his feet, Kriscila walked with her usual poise, but her eyes were heavy with exhaustion. Dain was the quietest of them all, his shoulders slumped, still processing everything Ryfel had pushed him through.

The warm scent of fresh food greeted them as they entered the common room, where Elda and Milal had prepared a spread of hearty meals. Ryker was already there, sitting back with a relaxed look, clearly waiting for them to settle down.

Ryker (grinning as he stood up, stretching slightly):
 "Well, well, look at you all. You look like you’ve been put through the grinder."

Bram (letting out a tired laugh):
 "You could say that again. We’ve barely had time to think straight, but we got through it."

Kriscila (eyeing the food, then looking around):
 "This is exactly what I needed."

Excitedly, both Bram and Kriscila dashed to the table and started devouring the delicious meals in front of them, losing all poise and etiquette at the dining hall.

Bram (eyebrow raised, looking at Kriscila):
 "Wah wah what? Who are you? No more ice queen poise?"

Kriscila (catching herself but with her mouth full):
 "Mmpfh. I apopojize, foo is too guud!"

Dain (softly, almost to himself):
 "Wow, it’s truly been a hell of a week. That’s a sight even I have never seen."

Ryker (chuckling):
 "It shows. You’ve all been working hard. So, how do you feel about tomorrow?"

Ryfel:
 "They’re ready. I wanted them to push beyond what they thought they could do, to become their own type of monster on the battlefield."

As Ryfel spoke, he noticed Elda and Milal exchanging pleased glances, clearly proud of the team’s progress. Milal reached over and handed him a plate, teasing slightly:

Milal (with a smirk):
 "I see you’ve kept them alive, at least."

Ryfel:
 "Barely. But they’ve went through the toughest parts. They’ll handle tomorrow."

Bram (playfully):
 "Hell yeah, we’ve been pushing ourselves like crazed animals. I can’t wait to smack the shit out of the other districts!"

Ryker (looking at Ryfel, his smile warm but knowing):
 "I’ve seen what you’ve done here, son. Your family is behind you too. Don’t carry the weight of this alone."

Elda (her voice gentle but firm):
 "You’ve done what you needed to do, my dear."

Ryfel:
 "We’re ready. 

From the Trials to the Champion, I have it all planned out."

The group sat together in the warmth of the Redimir household, the weight of the tournament looming—but for a moment, it felt like they could take on anything.
