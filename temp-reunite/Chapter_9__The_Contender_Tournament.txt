Chapter 9: The Contender Tournament

The Morning of the Tournament

The team had stayed the night at the Redimir household, a rare moment of rest before the chaos of the tournament. Ryfel woke early, slipping out of bed and into his morning taichi routine in the quiet of the house. Afterwards, he moved through the halls silently, his mind sharp and focused on the trials ahead.

In the kitchen, the smell of fresh bread and sizzling food filled the air. Milal and Elda were already up, preparing a hearty breakfast for the team.

Milal (glancing up from the stove):
 "You’re up early, Young Master. Want some eggs?"

Ryfel (with a slight smile, taking a seat at the table):
"I would love some scrambled, poached and sunny side up please!"

Milal:
 "Oooh your usual! Oook! I will make a lot for your friends too!"

Ryfel:
"Hahaha my friends, that’s true. I have grown to like them quite a bit."

Bram (stretching from the padded floor and grinning):
 "Smells good! You sure you want to feed me this much? I’ll be ready for the tournament after this."

Kriscila (ruffled hair and annoyed in the morning):
 "You… (she pointed at Bram) Just don’t eat all of it cause I want some too. Their food is just too daaaam good."

As the team gathered around the table, the conversation shifted between training tactics to lighthearted banter. But Ryfel, his eyes flicking back to his mother as the team settled in, looked nervous.

Ryfel (quietly, almost as an afterthought):
 "Mom... I know you’ve never been a fan of watching the tournament, but... I think it would mean a lot if you came this time."

Elda paused for a long moment, the sound of sizzling eggs the only noise filling the kitchen.

Elda (after a long silence, looking at him with a soft smile):
 "You know, I’ve always been more comfortable staying behind because I don’t like violence... but for you, Ryfel... I’ll be there. This time."

After breakfast, the team and family head towards the arena.

The atmosphere around the arena was electric. It had been ten years since the last Contender Tournament, and the crowds were just as lively as ever.

The roars of the spectators filled the air, the smell of street food and the hum of music weaving through the endless stalls set up along the arena’s outer perimeter.

Vendors shouted to passersby, offering drinks, team tunics, and memorable trinkets from the previous and current tournaments.

People from all over Minas-Col, and beyond, had gathered to watch the best contenders face off in the arena. Families, district tourists, and old warriors from past tournaments stood together in a massive, boisterous crowd that flooded the streets.

The Redimir family and Ryfel’s team were just about to enter the waiting area, where the participants stood before their matches. The walls echoed with the noise from the outside, but inside the waiting room was quieter, more focused.

Meanwhile, as the participants gathered for their opening matches, the atmosphere in the waiting room grew more charged. But beyond the competition, in the hidden corners of the arena and even among the officials, there was influences at play. 

Whispers passed between minute shadowed figures in the crowd, a subtle exchange of glances and gestures that seemed too purposeful for mere spectators. Several among the officials glanced assuredly toward the distant walls, eyes lingering for a moment too long.

Among the officials and spectators, a few individuals, unnoticed by most, kept their attention on the tournament’s progress. They moved with a careful balance of waiting and watching. 

The tournament’s outcome was of no real concern to them; it was the delay, the distraction that mattered, the real target, the walls of the Farmland district.



As the team lined up for the opening match, Ryfel caught the look from his family—Ryker giving a proud nod, Elda watching with a nervous breath for her baby son, and Milal, chomping away on her favourite honey-glazed eels.

The gates creaked open and Ryfel’s team stepped onto the battlefield, a hush fell over the arena. Then, a wave of murmurs rippled through the stands as the spectators got a good look at them.

Bram, clad in his towering boulder-like armor, moved like a mountain sliding like a snail, the heavy stone plating gleaming under the sun but with his head poking out. 

Dain wasn’t much better—his armor was sleeker, but the small vents across his suit made him look like a walking cheese grater.

Kriscila, with her weapons subtly coiled around her arms and waist, floated out like a Medusa made of chains.

The crowd’s reactions came fast—and they weren’t subtle.

Spectator 1 (laughing):
 "Is that Farmland’s team or a traveling carnival?!"

Spectator 2 (snorting):
 "Are they serious?! Wha the fuuuuck, they look like absolute clowns! Bahahahaha"

Spectator 3 (mocking):
 "They’re just missing a bearded lady to complete their circus! Hahaha!"

More laughter rolled across the stands, some even pointing at Bram, who was standing tall and proud, completely unbothered.

Bram (grinning under his helmet, muttering):
 "He he heh, laugh it up. You’ll see soon enough."

At the noble booths, Ryker sat with arms crossed, watching calmly as if the crowd’s jeering didn’t even register.

Ryker (widely grinning, to himself):
 "Wahahaha! I am so proud!"

Beside him, Elda tucked herself slightly behind Ryker’s shoulder, her face half-hidden as she tried to avoid the gazes from nearby nobles.

Elda (muttering nervously, pinching Ryker’s tunic):
"Are you sure Ry? It looks a bit much..."

Milal, meanwhile, was on her fourteenth skewer of honey-glazed eel, mouth full but voice loud enough to carry over to the next booth.

Milal (leg up on the stands, half eaten skewer, fuming):
 "Whatcha laughing at ya jackasses! Wait till they beat the shit out of ya pretty boy and girls!"
 [She points her eaten skewer like a sword toward the arena.]
 "Beat the shit outta them, Young Master Ry!"

Ryker (smirking slightly):
 "Careful, Milal. They might throw you into the ring."

Milal (grinning, without missing a beat):
 "Let them try. Ha ha ha! I have too many skewers sticks to fight with!"

As the family’s banter continued, Ryfel’s team stood at the center of the field, ignoring the laughter, the whispers, and the amusement from the crowd. To them, it was just noise.

Ryfel (calmly to the team):
 "This is going to be fun."

Dain (grumbling):
 "Same by me. I’ll give them something to laugh about later."

Kriscila (dryly):
 "Try not to get smacked before that."

Bram (chuckling as he shifted his boulder-like body forward):
 "I’d pay to see their faces when I flatten the first one."

Ryfel (calming his thoughts):
 "I will win. This time, I will win."


Tournament Official:
“Ladies and Gentlemen! Welcome to the Contender Tournament of the Decade! Let’s commence our very first trial!”

The gong rings!

Ryfel:
“Alright you all know the plan. They’ll be fast. We can’t let them control the tempo. So go crazy."

As the match began, the Magic District team immediately split into their signature agile formations, throwing large pieces of glass and mirrors to the ground.

Using light manipulation to project illusions and teleporting around to confuse everyone. Dain’s eyes darted across the field, but before he could make a move, Bram was already sliding across the arena.

Bram (grinning maniacally, voice booming as he slammed his gauntlets into the ground):
“Hereeeeeeee’s Brammmmy!”

With a massive shockwave, the ground beneath the Magic District team’s feet cracked open, shattering the mirrors they placed, breaking their illusion and throwing two of their fighters off-balance.

Bram launches one of them into the air from a stomp and rams through them like a bus, knocking them out instantly.

Bram (yelling as he stood over his downed opponent):
“One down!”

The second Magic District fighter, still in the air, launched multiple blasts of light magic at Bram, all bouncing ineffective against his rock armor. All except one, it hit Bram cleanly in his face. 

Kriscila:
“Oh shit Bram! You ok?”

Smoke clears from Bram’s face, revealing the largest whitest grin along with a dark shade of goggles covering his eyes.

Bram (still grinning like a psycho):
“RY! My man! It worked! 2 weeks of brushing with my teeth pearly white reflecting most of the light away! Hahahaha it doesn’t hurt at all!”

The crowd bursts out laughing from the spectacle, being even more impressed that Bram withstood the damage.

Without hesitation, Bram charged again, taking down the second fighter with a powerful punch that left them sprawled across the floor.



Meanwhile, Kriscila was already on the move. As the other two members of the Magic District tried to take advantage of the chaos, they teleported behind Kriscila, aiming to strike.

But before they could even react, Kriscila’s chains whipped through the air, entangling one fighter’s arms and slamming them against the arena’s edge.

Kriscila (mildly surprised):
“Ryfel’s right again. Their tricks are really simple once you understand them.”

Using one of her chains, she takes Dain and throws him towards the last remaining member of the Magic district.

“Usually, I would want to throw you headfirst into a wall, but this will do.” 

She jabs at Dain.

Dain:
“I’m going to catch you, you dam backup dancers!”

Dain grabs hold of his opponent after being launched. In reaction, the ‘backup dancer’ frantically spun and tried to wriggle away from Dain, shooting rocks, pebbles, water balls and shots of wind and light at him; in a desperate attempt to get away.

Dain (masochistically grinning):
“Yeeeesss, hit me, HIT ME!” 

Dain takes a bite out of the magic dancer, hugs him tightly, and starts sprouting shrapnel from his body.

“Eat this! Body Detonation!”

The last member of the Magic district instantly faints.

Kriscila:
“Ewwww, did you just name your attack?”

Bram:
“Daaaain my man! That was next level psycho! Hahahaha! I’m going to start naming my attacks too!”

Kriscila:
“Please don’t…”

In the midst of the fainted fighters of the Magic district, Ryfel walks up to his team and takes one of the broken mirrors from the battlefield and puts it into his belt.

Ryfel:
“Well executed guys! Told you they were easy!”

As the crowd witnessed what just happened, mocking laughter from all other districts died down, replaced by shocked murmurs.

Spectator 1:
“They just took down the Champion’s district in an instant.”

And then it happened. Ryker, walked up to the forefront of the Farmland District’s section, raised his hands high, as if the entire victory was already in his grasp.

Ryker (grinning wide, voice booming over the crowd):
“Wahahahah! You see that districts! That is my son’s present to all of you! And my Boy, this is MY present to you!”

As he finished, the entire Farmland District erupted in unison. Large flags and banners suddenly arose in the Farmland crowd. 

Accompanied by massive drums and chants, it became deafening to all other districts as they reel in from the shock of the earlier moment.

The cheers weren’t just for the district’s representation in the tournament; they were for the team, for Ryfel, for everything they had built.

The crowd shifted—now, every eye was on the team. Bram, Kriscila, Dain, and Ryfel, the current centre of attention.

Bram (grinning, raising his own arms back at the crowd):
“HELL YEA! I got fans now! Brrrring me the ladieessss!”

Ryfel chuckled, but his eyes focused ahead, there was a rare flicker of pride in his eyes as he stood at the forefront of the team.

Ryfel (softly, just enough for the team to hear):
“It ain’t over yet. Next phase, let’s go.”

Solo

Without hesitation, Bram, Kriscila, and Dain broke off immediately, heading toward the Blacksmith District, engaging in their own battle. The crowd had barely settled from the previous wipe of the Magic district when Ryfel walked alone into the center of the arena. 

His team was already engaged with the Blacksmith District, their clash starting to intensify in the distance. But Ryfel? He stood alone, facing two districts at once.

The spectators went silent, and for a moment, the whole arena seemed to hold its breath. Ryfel wasn’t even waiting for his opponents to make the first move. He simply raised one hand—slowly, deliberately, and with a confidence that was almost unnerving.

Ryfel (motioning his fingers back slowly):
 "Come on."

The challenge hung in the air, sharp and clear.

The Air District fighters exchanged quick glances, and the Water District murmured amongst themselves. It was almost as though the entire arena could feel the tension, the disbelief slowly building among the spectators. The murmurs grew louder.

Spectator 1 (whispering, unsure):
 "Is he... challenging both districts? Alone?"

Spectator 2 (in shock, not believing it):
 "No way. There’s no way he’s serious, right? What is he thinking?"

The crowd shifted, growing uneasy. The magic users from both districts stood tall, their confidence faltering in the face of Ryfel’s unwavering resolve.

The crowd began to doubt. Had he lost his mind? What was he thinking? Even the other competitors in the stands were now staring, some of them distracted by the audacity of the challenge. Eight fighters versus one? This was madness.

And then it happened.

Water Fighter (scoffing, stepping forward):
 "Who do you think you are? Do you really believe you can take us all down? You're just a kid!"

Air Fighter (flying into the air, laughing loudly):
 "You’ve got no idea what you're up against, boy. We’ve trained for years to fight as a team. You think you can just walk up and challenge us? How disrespectful!"

But Ryfel didn’t flinch. His expression remained calm, almost amused.

Ryfel (cool, his voice carrying to the entire arena):
 "Yup I am a kid. It is gonna be real sad for you to lose to a kid, especially when it is 1 versus 8. Come at me however you want to.”

(He looked up to the Air Fighter with a slight smirk and pointed at him.)

"And don’t cry when you lose."

The entire crowd held its breath. The mocking challenge rang out, not just to the Water and Air Districts, but to the crowd itself.

The audience was stunned, the challenge rippled through them like a wave. It wasn’t just a simple taunt—it was the audacity, the confidence in his voice, the way he carried himself like he was untouchable against everyone here.

Spectator 3 (wide-eyed, whispering):
 "Did he just taunt them like that? He’s going to fight them alone?"

Spectator 4 (almost incredulous):
 "Not even Aurex has ever done something like this before. Who does he think he is?"

Spectator 5 (booing loudly):
“I can’t wait for his cocky ass to get beat!”

Elda (watching in the stands, eyes fixed on Ryfel with a soft sigh):
 "He’s always been stubborn, but this..."

Milal (next to her, shouting):
 "You got guts, Young Master! Kick their ass!"

As the Air and Water District fighters exchanged another glance, it was clear they weren’t going to let this stand. They rushed forward, attacking from both sides.

Water Fighter (summoning a massive wave, trying to drown Ryfel):
 "You won’t walk away from this!"

But Ryfel didn’t move, still standing there, eyes focused, a calm smile on his face. 

The water wave crashed toward him, but Ryfel raised two fingers, Earth magic swelling beneath his feet, and a massive earth wall erupted in front of him, shattering the wave before it could touch him.

Air Fighter (moving swiftly, shooting wind blades from above):
 "Take this!"

The wind blades cut through the air with incredible speed, but Ryfel wasn’t surprised. He summoned his own blast of wind, countering their blades and sending them spiraling into the sky, out of control.

With a flick of his wrist, he pulled on the wind, creating a massive gust that threw the Air fighter off balance and sent him crashing to the ground.

In that instant, Ryfel took the water from the wave he broke and flung it to the Air Fighter freezing him instantly up to his neck, adding an earth stem from the ground right into his head, knocking him out.

The other Water Fighter flung over a harpoon and threw a net in order to hinder Ryfel from moving.

Instead, Ryfel caught it with one hand, as he finished off the Air Fighter and pulled the Water Fighter across the field with a twist strengthened by earth magic below.

The stunned Water Fighter flew from his position, with Ryfel timingly throwing him into his own net still in the air.

A final strengthened pull, he slammed the Water Fighter right into the ground in front of him, knocking him out. He added a quick non-lethal earth shot to his temple for extra good measure, as learned from his days in the SEALs.

The crowd was dead silent now, still in complete shock.

Ryfel had barely moved, barely broken a sweat. He hadn’t just defended himself—he had destroyed their attack with little more than a flick of his hand.

And now, with the first two fighters down, the rest of the Water and Air Districts were clearly rethinking their strategy.

Ryfel (looking down at the fallen fighters, then casually pointing once again to the remaining fighters):
 "You wanted a fight, but I didn’t even need to try."

Transport District Leader:
“You egotistical asshole! I am gonna end you right now! Fighters! Formation D!”

The remaining three Air Fighters took to the sky immediately, they flew quickly towards Ryfel surrounding him. A gust of wind encircled Ryfel, kicking up a duststorm.

Transport District Leader:
“Let’s see how you can fight when you can’t even see or reach us!”

However, from the duststorm, a sudden mechanical contraption flew high out of it in the middle of all three of them.

“Click click click… BANG!”

A sound like a thunderclap, its deafening roar filled the air. A blinding white light exploded from the device, washing out everything in its path. For a split second, the world of the Air Fighters seemed to freeze—ears ringing and vision wiped clean.

All Air Fighters:
“AHHHH, my eyes!”

Ryfel stamped his foot to the ground. In an instant, earth magic surged beneath him, propelling him upwards at blinding speed, launching him out of the duststorm amd directly toward the nearest Air Fighter, who was still disoriented from the flashbang’s effects.

The Air Fighter barely had time to react before Ryfel slammed into him, grabbing him by the collar mid-air. 

With a quick Spider-Man motion, Ryfel used his gauntlets to shoot out two grappling hooks, catching the remaining two Air Fighters in a perfect trap.

Ryfel (smirking as he reeled them in):
 "You’re not as fast as you think."

The hooks yanked the fighters towards him, their speed too much for them to control, and they collided with the fighter Ryfel was on with a force that disoriented them further.

Without missing a beat, Ryfel wrapped them up together, binding them in mid-air using the grappling hooks to trap them.

Now, with all three of them in his grasp, Ryfel focused on the weaknesses in their armor.

Channeling air from above, he shot a sharp gust of wind that launched straight into their exposed armor gaps that were used for flight.

The sudden blast sent them spiraling toward the ground at impossible speed—a sonic boom that shook the entire arena.

They plummeted downward, unable to break free, crashing with a sickening thud into the dirt, knocked out cold.

The crowd gasped. As Ryfel descended slowly.

And after a short moment of stunned silence, erupted in cheers, as the air fighters lay motionless.

Ryker (his grin wide, raising his hands to the crowd):
"THAT’S MY BOY! NOW YOU SEE WHAT FARMLAND CAN DO!"



The Aquaculture District Fighters retreated to the edge of the arena, still reeling from the spectacle of Ryfel’s single-handed takedown of the Air Fighters.

Their confidence had crumbled, and now all that remained was a sense of desperation as they stared down the lone fighter who had just obliterated their opponents.

Water Fighter 1 (frantic, voice tight with tension):
 "What the hell just happened? How is he this strong?! We can’t go in like that! He’ll tear us apart!"

Water Fighter 2 (shaken, trying to catch his breath):
 "We will outlast him with water. We drown him, freeze him—anything!"

Water Leader:
 "No! Don’t freak out! Calm down and stick to our strategy and formation!"

Their hands trembled as they began channeling water into the arena, but it was clear—they were now in a state of uncertainty.

They needed to make this work, but the Air Districts’ failure had already left a deep wound to their confidence.

The Water fighters raised their hands to summon a large pools of water, their combined efforts creating a towering wave from all sides that surged toward Ryfel, ready to trap him in an icy grasp.

Ryfel (unfazed, standing still, arms crossed, thinking):
 "Oh interesting move, but still the wrong one."

As the wave loomed closer, Ryfel reached into his belt and pulled out a small broken mirror—a simple object, but one that he had taken from the battle with the Magic District.

Ryfel (smirking, whispering to himself):
 "Time to turn the tide."

Right before the wave crashed into him, Ryfel dropped the mirror at an angle right below his feet, creating an illusion of himself.

In that same instant, he opened the earth, and he created a hole in the ground, tunneling his way toward his first target. 

The illusion he created made it seem as if he was still standing right in the path of the wave, helpless and about to be engulfed by it.

The Water Fighters saw the illusionary Ryfel, frozen in place by the crushing wave. They smiled with confidence, knowing they had trapped him.

The Water fighter raised his hands, getting the water to constantly freeze into solid ice, sealing the fake Ryfel inside.

Water Leader (satisfied, looking over at the others):
 "Got him. He’s trapped."

But what they didn’t see, what they didn’t anticipate, was the real Ryfel underground. While the fighters watched the illusion of Ryfel trapped within the frozen water, Ryfel tunneled beneath the earth, moving silently and quickly toward the nearest Water fighter.

The moment Ryfel reached his target, he erupted from the earth, grabbing the Water fighter’s legs and dragging him down into the ground with unrelenting force.

The Water fighter screamed in shock, trying to summon water to break free, but Ryfel’s earth manipulation was unstoppable.

Ryfel (grinning, his voice dark and calm):
 "You shouldn’t have let your guard down."

The Water fighter struggled to break free, but the earth closed in around him up to his neck, Ryfel launched an earth stem right to his temple knocking him out.

The remaining Water fighters looked at the spot where Ryfel had been, expecting to see his cold body trapped in ice, but instead, at some angles, they noticed that his frozen image looked 2-Dimensional instead.

Water Fighter 2 (eyes wide in disbelief):
 "Oh shit! It’s a Magic trick! Where did he go?!"

They looked around frantically, realizing they had been fooled by the illusion. Panic set in as they couldn’t find Ryfel’s body, and for the briefest of moments, they were unsure of what to do next.

The leader realized that one of his fighters went missing.

Water Leader:
 "Blake is gone! What happened to him!"

Water Fighter 2 (stunned and almost vomiting):
 "AHHHHH! I see his head! H-, h-… He got decapitated?"

While the Water fighters were once again distracted, Ryfel took full advantage. 

Tunnelling up towards the stunned Water Fighter, he jumped out of a hole behind him, locking his neck into a chokehold. 

With vomit in his mouth, his breath short, it only took 10 seconds for him to pass out. Ryfel dove back into his tunnels of demise.

Water Leader:
 "River! Noooo!"

Immediately, the Water Leader conjured a water barrier surrounding him, leaving no gaps that could enter from above ground.

Water Leader (panicking):
 "Whe- Where did he go? I couldn’t even see what just happened."

As Ryfel started getting closer like an underground shark to a diver in a cage, he started spawning holes that would open and close near the self-cornered panicked leader.

With every hole having a possibility of Ryfel appearing, the leader started playing whack-a-mole by shooting icicles from his water cage.

Water Leader (even more frantic):
 "Die die die! You little shit!"

The water barrier started to thin as more icicles were shot out at the mischevous apprearing holes. Once again, with the barrier on the ground underneath the leader disappered, Ryfel opens a hole behind him, throwing up a sonic bomb.

BOOM! 

Biiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiii.

The sonic blast amplified as it echoed inside the water barrier, The sound ripped through the arena, and the Water leader’s hands shot to his ears as the sonic waves tore into his eardrums. The sound seemed to freeze time, drowning out everything else.

Water Leader (mentally going deaf, screaming in agony):
 "ARUGHGHHHHHHHH!"

His water barrier drops and Ryfel appears up from a hole slowly in front of him, as he dances in pain, completely overwhelmed by the ringing.

The entire arena fell silent, but in that stillness, there was a growing sense of anticipation. Every eye was on Ryfel now—the Farmland District's champion.

He openly cupped his hand to his ear. Gesturing the crowd to roar.

Contender Crowd (except for the Aquaculture District, chanting in unison):
"FINISH HIM! FINISH HIM! FINISH HIM!"

Ryfel steps forward… In one of the biggest disrespects that the arena has ever seen. With one fluid movement, Ryfel reached up to the throat of the flicked the Water Leader and flicked hard; cutting off his ability to breathe. 

The Water leader collapsed to the ground, unconscious from the pain, disorientation, and the final, disrespectful flick. As Ryfel stood over him watching him crumple.

The crowd’s roars only intensified as Ryfel stood tall, hands on his hips, watching his defeated opponent. The arena felt like it had exploded, the noise drowning out everything else.

Farmland District Fans (shouting with wild approval):
 "FARMLAND! FARMLAND! FARMLAND!"

Even Elda, in the stands, watched in pride, her heart swelling with pride for the son who had made the impossible look easy.

Ryker (with a grin on his face, raising his arms to the crowd):
 "THIS IS MY SON! AND HE WILL BE YOUR NEW CHAMPIOOON!"

Solo 2?

Meanwhile, Bram, Kriscila, and Dain continued their fight with the Blacksmith District, it quickly became evident that Garrik, Viktor, and Tomas had grown into powerful adult fighters—far more experienced, far stronger than when they were watched by Ryfel 10 years ago.

Garrik (now 28, muscles rippling beneath his armor):
"You think you first-timer kids can just waltz in and challenge us? You Farmlanders were already easy 10 years ago, it will just be the same today."

The Blacksmith team had clearly beefed up over the years. Garrik was brimming with raw strength, his greatsword swinging with the power of a man who had spent years honing his craft.

Viktor, now a master tactician, had refined his strategic thinking and was using the environment to his advantage. Meanwhile, the reckless Tomas was brimming with impatience—he wanted to overwhelm Farmland’s team with sheer aggression.

The fight had turned intense, with Bram struggling to keep up against Garrik’s brute strength, Kriscila barely dodging Viktor’s cunning traps, and Dain trying to use his kamikaze style to break through the Blacksmiths’ defense.

But their strength and endurance were starting to show—they weren’t backing down.

Bram gritted his teeth, barely repairing his armor from a crushing swing from Garrik.


While Kriscila was fighting off Viktor’s traps along with her chains constantly getting melted away.

Dain, on the other hand was enjoying getting hit from Tomas’s wild attacks.


Bram:
 "My super boulder armor! It’s not gonna withstand this much longer!"

Kriscila:
 "I am running out of chains too! I need to retreat!"

Dain:
 "No kidding! As much as I am loving this, we’re gonna need help..."

Just as the Blacksmith District seemed to gain the upper hand, Ryfel stepped forward from the cloud of dust he had just came from, accompanied by whole arena cheering from his back.

The cheering from the crowd seemed to swell even louder, echoing through the arena, shaking the walls and shaking the Blacksmith District team for a second. For a brief moment, even Bram, Dain, and Kriscila could feel the power of their district’s champion.

The weight of Farmland’s reputation was now on Ryfel's shoulders, and he was carrying it like a true leader.

But as the Blacksmith District stood tall, Garrik, the towering figure of the group, grinned widely. He swung his greatsword in a wide arc, the weapon crushing the air with the force of his movement.

Garrik (grinning, eyes full of confidence):
 "Gyahahaha, I love what you guys did to the Magic District. We had a bone to pick with them anyway."

Viktor, the strategist of the group, crossed his arms and sized Ryfel up with a calculated gaze. He wasn’t as loud as Garrik, but his cool demeanor and sharp eyes made him seem even more dangerous.

Viktor (contemplating, his voice steady):
 "Yes. We could have done what you did... We figured out their tricks already."

Tomas, however, wasn’t the calm strategist or warrior—he was fueled by aggression, his fists clenched tightly as he stared Ryfel down.

The disrespect he felt from being underestimated boiled over, and before anyone could stop him, he rushed forward with a furious battle cry, his molten gauntlets jutting out glowing claws, ready to burn everything in his path.

Tomas (shouting, eyes wild with fury):
 "But yooooou... You think you can take us alone? Me of all people? I will gut you like a fucking fish!"

Ryfel (raising an eyebrow, unfazed by Tomas’s sudden attack):
 "Woah, woah, pretty aggressive much?"

Before Tomas could reach him, Ryfel slid back effortlessly. He dodged Tomas’s wild charge by creating a pillar of stone to push himself into the air, just out of Tomas’s reach.

Tomas (snarling, unable to stop his momentum):
 "You damn coward, stand still!"

Ryfel (smirking as he remained high above Tomas):
 "Are you stupid? Who would stand still against that?"

As Tomas swung his molten claws, the heat radiating off of them intense enough to burn through anything in its path, Ryfel simply used earth magic to form a wall of stone beneath him. The molten strikes hit the stone, creating sparks and heat melting half of Ryfel’s earth barrier.

Ryfel (landing, as he formed another stone platform beneath his feet):
 "Well, if you want me to stand still, let me show you how you would still lose"

Ryfel gathered water and earth into his gauntlets and armor, simultaneously cooling and circulating it around his body. 

He launched forward from his stone platform, closing the distance between him and Tomas in the blink of an eye. 

With a sharp twist, Ryfel disarmed Tomas, sending the molten gauntlet flying out of his hand, landing a few feet away. The fire claws clanged against the stone ground before sliding to a stop, far out of Tomas’s reach.

The crowd roared, amazed at how easily Ryfel had stripped Tomas of his most dangerous weapon on his dominant arm, whilst using earth to capture and twist Tomas’s other arm in a painful lock.

Tomas (grunting in pain, trying to fight back):
"Augh! You fucker!"

The crowd was stunned by the speed at which Ryfel had dismantled Tomas’s reckless assault. Farmland’s fans erupted, their cheers growing louder with every movement.

Farmland District Fans (chanting, cheering):
 "Ryfel! Ryfel! Ryfel!"

Kriscila (watching with disbelief, voice full of awe):
 "He’s unstoppable..."

Bram (shaking his head, grinning):
 "Damn, that was too easy. I’m almost jealous."

Kriscila:
 "Ry! Watch out!"

The warning came too late. Viktor, always the strategist, had slipped behind Ryfel unnoticed, his dual molten blades gleaming in the dim light of the arena. With surgical precision, Viktor launched his strike in an X motion, aiming directly for Ryfel’s neck.

Viktor (coldly, his voice calm as he swung):
 "You’re not as untouchable as you think."

In the blink of an eye, Ryfel forced air magic down to his head, dodging Viktor’s deadly molten blades by mere inches.

He channelled air into armor to instantly fly out of his disadvantageous position.

Kriscila:
 "Behind you! Ry Ry!"

Bram and Dain (turning to Kriscila):
 "Ry Ry???"

Garrik appeared, his greatsword drawn to the height of Ryfel’s flight path. The sword started blowing fire from its blade, he slammed it to the ground and caused multiple intense towering infernos around him.

The ground beneath him cracked with the force of his strike, sending flames spiralling into the sky. The fire walls shot up, a barrier of blazing heat that surrounded Ryfel from all directions.

Garrik (shouting, his voice booming):
 "You think you can outdo me? Watch this!"

The fire walls surged higher, closing in on Ryfel. The heat was intense, the air now oppressively hot, the roar of the flames filling the arena. 

For a moment, as Ryfel landed back amidst the flames, the crowd flinched, thinking Ryfel was trapped. But Ryfel, unfazed, calmly assessed the situation, his mind moving ahead of his opponents.

Ryfel (smiling to himself, voice calm in the chaos):
 "So you’re relying on fire now? I can do that too."

With a sudden burst of energy, Ryfel’s earth magic surged beneath him. He split the ground to create a circular barrier, using the earth to shield himself from the flames. As the fire walls closed in, Ryfel turned his attention back to Garrik.

Ryfel’s Counterattack: Fire vs. Fire

Garrik swung his flaming greatsword, sending fire jets toward Ryfel, but Ryfel was already one step ahead.

He summoned a massive burst of fire from the ground beneath him, amplifying the flames and sending them back at Garrik’s attack, redirecting the fire with his own flame flow and earth.

The fire clashed mid-air, creating an explosive shockwave that sent the arena into chaos. Ryfel didn’t stop there; as the fire began to fizzle, he raised his fists and launched fireballs at Garrik, forcing him to dodge.

Garrik (snarling, trying to keep up with the barrage):
 "You think fire can stop me?!"

Ryfel:
 "Not at all. It’s the inventions that I made better than your district that will end you."

With a swift motion, Ryfel summoned more earth beneath Garrik’s feet, lifting him off the ground and causing the earth to collapse beneath him. Garrik had no time to adjust before Ryfel launched a massive pillar of earth, slamming it upward into Garrik’s chest, throwing him backward into the arena floor.

Ryfel:
 "I am going to take away the armor you are so proud off."

Ryfel dashes forward to the stumbled Garrik, attaching numerous sticky frag grenades he activated, taken from his belt. He turns to Viktor and a recently freed one-arm working Tomas and makes his way there.

BOOM!

The frag grenades exploded with deafening force, shattering Garrik’s armor and sending him reeling backward into the dirt. The shockwave knocked the wind out of him, and he lay there, barely conscious, the heat of the blast still hanging in the air. Ryfel barely glanced back at him, his focus now on the remaining threats—Viktor and Tomas.

Tomas gritted his teeth, his only molten gauntlet still sizzling, while Viktor carefully adjusted his stance, strategically calculating his next move.

Viktor (filled with rage):
 "We’re not done. You’ll regret underestimating us."

Tomas (snarling, reckless as always):
 "I’m gonna burn you alive!"

Viktor and Tomas wasted no time. Viktor launched duals shortsword strikes, each blade cutting the air as he advanced with speed and precision. Tomas, still filled with embarrassed fury, charged in alongside him, his one molten claw and harden fist trying to overwhelm Ryfel in a brutal assault.

Ryfel created spikes of rock that shot out of the ground, forcing Tomas to dodge. As Viktor lunged forward, Ryfel slid backward, raising his hand to create a wall of stone in his path, blocking Viktor’s swords just in time. The force of the collision sent a mini shockwave through the arena, but Ryfel barely flinched.

Viktor (gritting his teeth):
 "This is only the beginning, Ryfel!"

Tomas, now slightly off balance from the rock spikes, raised his molten gauntlet and swung wildly at Ryfel, aiming to catch him off guard with the fiery heat from his strike. Ryfel quickly dropped a flashbang grenade from his belt, throwing it at Tomas’s feet.

BOOM!
Biiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiii

 The explosive flash blinded Tomas just as he swung, the deafening sound rattling his eardrums. He stumbled back, disoriented.

Without a moment's hesitation, Ryfel grabbed Tomas by his armor and slammed him into the ground, using his earth magic to create a stone coffin that locked around Tomas’s body, rendering him immobile. He then created a water bubble around his head, Tomas’s fiery gauntlets flared, but it was too late—he couldn’t break free, as he respired into unconsciousness.

Viktor (gritting his teeth):
 "TOMAS!!! I’m going to kill you Ryfel Redimir!"

His dual shortswords blazed in his hands as he rushed forward, using his speed and finesse to blitz Ryfel in a flurry of slashes from every angle. Ryfel, however, was faster. He dodged Viktor’s strikes with fluid precision, anticipating each slash and dodging at the last second. 

Using his grappling hook, he shot it across Viktor’s path, latching onto an earth pillar and pulling it back fast. It slammed right into Viktor’s armor, sending him flying straight into Ryfel.

Viktor (grunting, thrown off-balance, his breath catching):
"Damn it!"

Ryfel:
“Since you like fire so much, have more of it and more of how it stings your senses.”

Ryfel launched an incendiary grenade toward the staggering Viktor, followed by a tear gas grenade that landed right beside him. Viktor’s eyes widened as he realized too late that he was trapped. Ryfel stomped the ground, and in an instant, a massive earth enclosure erupted around Viktor, trapping him inside with no escape.

Viktor (eyes widening in panic, gasping for air):
 "What—no, no!"

Before Viktor could react, the grenades discharged, releasing a blinding burst of flames and a cloud of thick, choking smoke that filled the confined space.

The fire from the incendiary grenade scorched the air, while the tear gas overwhelmed Viktor’s senses, making it nearly impossible for him to see or breathe properly. The intense heat stung his skin as the smoke burned his lungs, causing him to cough violently.

Viktor (clutching his throat, his body shaking from the heat and gas):
 "Agh! I ca-can’t breathe!"

But Ryfel wasn’t done. As Viktor tried to struggle and breathe through the fumes, stone pillars shot up from the ground, locking in on Viktor’s limbs, forcing him to the ground and to heavily breathe in the fumes and flames.

Ryfel (stepping forward, voice low and commanding):
 "That seems enough. You’re already done."

Ryfel dissolved the earth cage, as Viktor lay there, breathing heavily, his body drenched in sweat, and his eyes filled with a mix of disbelief and defeat.

Last Man Standing

However, it wasn’t over.

As the arena roared in a mix of disbelief and anticipation, Garrik rose from the dust, his greatsword blazing with fire as he fueled it with intense rage.

Garrik (snarling, eyes blazing with fury):
 "You think you’ve beaten me? I will carve your face into my mantle!"

In a fluid motion, Garrik split his greatsword into two fiery blades, each one crackling with intense heat. With each swing, the earth cracked beneath him, sending blazing fire ripping through the ground.

The fire slashes came at Ryfel, scorching the earth and sending lines of fire through the arena.

Garrik (roaring as he slashed again):
 "REDIMIR! This will be your grave!"

The arena shook with the force of his swings, the fire slashes closing in on Ryfel. The fire sliced through the air, the heat so intense it caused the ground to crack open, and the flames exploded out from the deep cracks.

Ryfel (narrowing his eyes):
 "Come on, I’ve seen this before."

Ryfel’s earth magic was already working in tandem with his every move. As Garrik’s flames descended, Ryfel raised the earth beneath him, creating tall stone pillars to shield himself from the intense heat.

Garrik (grinning, sweat pouring down his face as he swung his fiery blades):
 "You think you can hide from me?!"

The fire slashes erupted on impact with the stone pillars, but Ryfel wasn’t hiding—he was calculating.

The fire engulfed the earth, but Ryfel used the heat to his advantage. He dug deep into the earth, creating stone catapults from beneath, sending chunks of large rocks flying in every direction, and forcing Garrik to dodge.

Ryfel:
 "I will take down what you are truly most proud about."

As Garrik continued his barrage, Ryfel dropped down, creating a hole beneath him and tunnelling way deeper under the ground than before, out of the range of the flames. The fire burned above him, but Ryfel’s control of the earth allowed him to maneuver without fear.

Ryfel reached towards the earth below Garrik’s feet and cracked it open, sending sharp spikes shooting upward. The spikes pierced the ground just beneath Garrik, forcing him to stumble backwards in pain. The fire from his blades flickered, but Ryfel wasn’t done.

As Garrik struggled to regain balance, Ryfel’s opened more holes to shoot out his grappling hooks, binding Garrik’s legs and arms in place.

As Garrik struggled more, more hooks started binding into his flesh, trapping him deeper and deeper.

With Garrik trapped and unable to move, Ryfel appeared from the hole in front of him and stepped forward. 

Garrik (gritting his teeth, breathing heavily):
"I’ll... never... fall to you..."

The crowd in unison chanted with Ryfel’s signature move:
“DISRESPECT! DISRESPECT! DISRESPECT!”

With one final motion, using earth magic covered his arms and solidifying it to the hardest extent. He stepped forward, putting his hands on Garrik’s incredibly crafted greatswords and crushed the fire blades with his ‘bare’ hands, shattering them into pieces. 

He slams his fist right into Garrik’s jaw, sending him back to the ground, unconscious.

Ryfel (standing over the defeated Garrik, voice firm):
 "It’s over."



It’s Over

The arena erupted in thunderous applause, the Farmland District cheering like never before. Ryfel had single-handedly defeated the Blacksmith District, no all the districts together—not just with power, but with intelligence, strategy, and control over every element he commanded.

Farmland District Fans (shouting in unison):
"RYFEL! RYFEL! RYFEL! RYFEL! RYFEL! RYFEL! RYFEL! RYFEL! RYFEL! RYFEL! RYFEL! RYFEL! RYFEL! RYFEL! RYFEL! RYFEL! RYFEL! RYFEL! RYFEL! RYFEL! RYFEL! RYFEL! RYFEL! RYFEL! RYFEL! RYFEL! RYFEL! RYFEL! RYFEL! RYFEL!"

Kriscila (watching in awe):
 "He just... dismantled them. Like they were nothing."

Bram (laughing, punching Dain on the shoulder):
 "That’s what I’m talking about. He’s untouchable!"

Dain (still wide-eyed):
 "No kidding... He made it look like a walk in the park."

As the crowd cheered, Ryfel stood tall, his hands on his hips, looking at the fallen fighters. He had proven that Farmland wasn’t just a district of farmers—it was a force to be reckoned with.



Varian Draganov, the lord of the Blacksmith District, sat in stunned silence for a moment. His fists clenched at his sides, the only sound coming from his labored breathing. The loss of his sons, the defeat of his district, had shattered him, and it was more than he could bear. The embarrassment was too much for his pride to handle.

With a sudden outburst of frustration, Varian grabbed the banquet table in front of him. His fingers curled into fists, the veins in his neck bulging with rage.

He didn’t even hesitate. With a violent motion, he flipped the heavy wooden table, sending goblets, plates, and silverware flying.

But instead of letting it crash to the floor, Varian hurled the table toward the battlefield with all his might.

The giant wooden table flew out of the noble booth, above the crowd below and into the arena, a blur of wooden chaos, landing with a deafening crash on the field far from the stands.

The table splintered, sending a shockwave of debris across the arena, the force of the throw making it seem like a force of nature had just been unleashed.

The crowd gasped, unable to comprehend the raw anger of the Blacksmith Lord. The giant table crashed right in front of Garrik, Viktor, and Tomas, awakening them from their stupor.

They had been stunned, lying in defeat, but the crash of the table roused them. The brothers looked up at their father, their faces filled with confusion, pain, and frustration.

Varian (his voice low, filled with fury as he stormed off):
 "You’ve embarrassed me... all of you. You were supposed to win. You were supposed to carry our name!"

He didn’t even spare a second glance at his sons as he stormed off toward the exit, leaving the noble section in dead silence. The tension in the arena was palpable, as Varian’s fury filled the air.

He had always been a figure of strength and intimidation, but now, his pride had been shattered—and he couldn’t face the reality of his defeat.

The impact of his fury was felt by everyone around him—the nobles exchanged glances of confusion and hesitation, unsure how to react to such an outburst from the once-mighty lord.

But it wasn’t just the nobles—even the Blacksmith District’s second in command was rocked.

Varian (delusionally pointing out faults):
 "Your weapons Samson, they broke like fucking glass. How useless it was against a kid. A SIMPLE KID!”

Standing in the shadow of Lord Draganov, Samson Brigand and his twin daughters, Enya and Elia, looked on in stunned silence. They had always been proud of their father, proud of their equipment they created, proud of the Blacksmith District’s legacy, but now, they were witnessing something they never thought they’d see—their father’s pride shattered in front of an entire audience.



As Varian stormed off, the Blacksmith District fans in the stands looked on, confused and unsure of what to do.

The rule of an eye for an eye truly rings even in the matters of the heart. As Varian blamed everyone around him. Samson hanging his head in shame. Enya and Elia Brigand had rage starting to build in their hearts.

Enya and Elia (controlling their hands behind them):
"Our father and his skills made you what you are today… How dare you blame him for your failures.”

Meanwhile, Garrik, still recovering from his fight, looked toward the shattered table that now lay near him, a symbol of his father’s rage.

Garrik (gritting his teeth, struggling to stand):
 "He’s lost his mind... this is ridiculous."

Viktor, still bruised and disoriented, glanced at his brother. The intensity of their father’s outburst made it clear—this defeat was more than just a loss in battle. It was a deep wound to their family’s honor.

Viktor (shaking his head, bitterly):
 "This isn’t over. We’ll fix this, no matter what it takes."

Tomas, always the most reckless of the three, was the first to react. His anger burned hotter than the molten gauntlets that had already been broken. He pounded the ground in frustration, unable to accept their defeat.

Tomas (yelling, his voice thick with rage):
 "No one does this to me, no one. I will make them pay!"

But as the brothers continued to deal with their anger, the Blacksmith District fans in the stands had split into two camps.

Some of them were now walking away, disappointed, leaving the arena, unwilling to witness the fall of their district’s pride. Others, however, stayed seated, fists raised, and began cheering for a new potential champion in their love of the sport.
