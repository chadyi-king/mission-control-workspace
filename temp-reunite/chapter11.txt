Chapter 11: The Champion

Aftermath

The crowd’s cheers shook the arena, green banners waving high as Ryfel stood in the center of the broken cage, his silhouette framed by the fading flames, a champion ready for the ultimate challenge.



Bram lay in the dirt outside the shattered glass, unconscious but breathing, his ripped form battered from the relentless fight. Medics rushed to his side, but the crowd’s focus was on Ryfel—their champion, the one who would face Aurex for the title.

In the Farmland prep tent, Kriscila and Dain watched from the sidelines, their eyes wide from the intensity of the fight.

Kriscila (muttering, impressed):

“He’s unreal… how does he keep doing this?”



Dain (gruff, proud):

“Told you he’s a monster. But damn… that was something else.”



Bram groaned as the medics helped him sit up, his eyes fluttering open. He rubbed his jaw, wincing, but a wide grin spread across his face as he looked at Ryfel standing tall in the arena.



Bram (panting, laughing):

“You… you sneaky shit you, Hahaha Ry… you really got me good! Go kick Aurex’s ass for me, yeah?”



Ryfel turned, catching Bram’s words, and gave a small nod, a rare smile breaking through his calm demeanor.



Ryfel (smiling):

“I’ve got this, Bram. But you, you fought well.”



In the noble stands, Ryker, Elda, Milal, and Grandpa Ironfoot watched with a mix of emotions.



Ryker’s deep laugh rumbled through the section, his pride evident. Elda clapped softly, her eyes sparkling with admiration. Milal pumped a fist in the air, her fiery spirit unshaken. 



Grandpa Ironfoot, however, sat back, his grizzled face torn between disappointment and respect.



Ryker (laughing, proud) and Elda (smiling, soft):

“That’s our boy!”



Milal (cheering, fierce):

“I told you, old man! Ryfel’s gonna crush Aurex too!”



Grandpa Ironfoot (grumbling, but respectful):

“Hmph. my grandson would’ve won… but that Redimir kid… sneaky tricks. But all is fair. He’s really somethin’ else. Maybe he’s the one to take on Aurex after all.”



Memories of 10 Years Ago

The arena buzzed with energy as workers swarmed the battlefield, clearing the shattered glass, melted sand, and broken stone from Ryfel’s fight with Bram.



Over the next thirty minutes, earth mages among the crew reshaped the terrain, smoothing the dirt and repairing the scars of the tournament’s battles.



The crowd remained in the stands, their excitement undimmed, green banners waving high as they chanted Ryfel’s name, eager for the ultimate showdown with Champion Aurex.



In the Farmland waiting room, Ryfel sat on a bench, his breathing steady as he wiped sweat from his brow. His hooks rested at his side, glinting faintly in the dim light.



Kriscila leaned against a pole, her chains clinking softly, her eyes flickering between Ryfel and the ground.



Dain sat on a crate, still bruised but alert, watching Ryfel with quiet respect. 



Bram, now patched up by the medics, lounged nearby, a fresh skewer of grilled eel in hand, his grin as wide as ever despite the loss.



Bram (chewing, encouraging):

“You’re up against the big guy now, Ry! 



And to be honest, I'm kinda glad ya won. Even with speed, I wouldn’t even know how to fight him.”



Dain (gruff, supportive):

“Yeah. I’m sure you have a plan. You had strategies against everyone so far.”



Kriscila stayed silent for a moment, her gaze lingering on Ryfel. She pushed off the pole, stepping closer to tap him, her voice softer than usual.



Kriscila (quiet, sincere):

“Ryfel. Umm… Just… be careful, okay?”



Ryfel looked up, meeting her eyes, he took her hand and gave a small nod, his forehead touching the back of her hand, a flicker of warmth in his expression.



Ryfel (calm, steady):

“I will, Kriscila. Thanks.”



Bram and Dain at the sidelines heads tilted, bewildered by what just happened.



Bram (chewing and confused):

“Since when did this happen? I mean we all knew but… Whew…” 



Kriscila was slightly taken aback, blushing. Ryfel was happy at the gesture, but he had to focus. 



He closed his eyes, taking a deep breath, but his mind drifted back—back to a memory that had burned itself into his soul, a moment that had shaped him more than any other.



He was five years old, sitting in the stands of this very arena, watching Farmland’s warriors fall short in the Contender Tournament.



The noise around him had been deafening, the voices of thousands rising in excitement, yet to Ryfel, it had all felt like distant echoes. His breath had been steady, but only because he forced it to be. His mind, sharp beyond its years, had fractured into something deeper, something colder. 



He wasn’t watching the trials anymore—he was watching every misstep, every failure, every moment where Farmland’s warriors had fallen short.

His stomach had twisted, his fingers curling tighter against his lap, pressing into his palm until the pain grounded him. 



A shiver had run through his spine, but it wasn’t from the cold—it was disgust. 



He had always been a man of control. In his past life, power had not been something given to him—it had been something he took, something he bent to his will. And yet, there he was, watching his district become nothing more than an afterthought.



It had made his skin crawl. Milal had said something beside him, something about third place not being so bad, but it had barely registered before his mind had been swallowed whole by the thought that had been festering inside him: “I would have won.”



His body had burned, the weight of the emotions too big for a five-year-old’s body to contain, he remembered.



“Ten years,” he had thought, his breath sharp. “Ten more years and I will take the stage. No one will be above me.” 



The plans of where he would strike first, what terrain he would manipulate, how he would counter the illusions—how he would break them, one by one, until only he remained. 



A vow etched into his soul, a promise to never let Farmland be dismissed again, to never walk away in shame; to never lose.



Ryfel opened his eyes, the memory fading but its raging fire still burning in his chest. He stood, adjusting his gauntlets, his resolve unshaken. He had made that vow ten years ago, and now, he was here—Farmland’s champion, ready to face the one who had stood above all others, Aurex Solmere.





The Champion’s Arrival

The arena was restored, the battlefield a smooth expanse of packed dirt, ready for the final fight. The crowd’s chants grew louder and excited for how the fights had turned out this year, all anticipating that this final match would live up to its expectations. The Tournament Official stepped to the center, his voice booming over the stands.



Tournament Official (shouting, commanding):

“The Contender Individual Trials has its victor! 



Ryfel Redimir of Farmland will now face the Three Time Reigning Champion, the Sovereign of the Silver Mist, the Father of Bright Star Lux, Aurex Solmere!”



Ryfel emerged from the waiting room. The crowd erupted, green banners waving high, their cheers, a wave of support.



However, from across the field, the cheers burst forth louder than anyone has heard today, The stadium fully hyped up for the final match. His figure appeared from a misty waiting room, stepping into the arena with an aura of unshakable confidence—a true Sovereign of the Silver Mist, Aurex Solmere.

Aurex was tall, his frame lean but powerful, clad in sleek armor that shimmered with an otherworldly light, as if woven from the illusions he commanded.

His hair was a stark silver, tied back, and his eyes glowed faintly, a piercing gold that seemed to see through everything.

In his hands, he held the Swallow—a twin bladed spear that gleamed with a deceptive lightness, their edges whispering of precision and control.

The air around him rippled with magic, light bending in subtle, disorienting patterns.

Aurex (voice smooth, commanding):
“So, you’re the one who’s come this far, Ryfel Redimir. Farmland’s champion… 

I have seen the way you have fought. And I truly am looking forward to this battle. I have very… Very high hopes for you.”

Ryfel (steady, resolute):
“Respectfully Sovereign, I will be the one to end your thirty year reign. You are the best, but still I will win today.”

Aurex (laughing):
“Hahaha many have tried! But I will not underestimate any of my opponents including you, as I am sure you will do likewise.”

Both Aurex and Ryfel exchanged cheeky smiles.



The gong rang out, its deep echo signaling the start of the fight. The crowd fell silent, holding their breath as the two champions sprang into action.



Aurex moved first, his movements fluid and precise, like a dancer stepping onto a stage. He raised the Swallow, the twin blades catching the light as he channeled his magic. With a wave of his hand, he scattered glittering mirrors across the battlefield—small, reflective shards that embedded themselves into the dirt, their surfaces shimmering. 



The air around them bent, light fracturing into disorienting patterns, and then the illusions began to form.

One Aurex became two, then four, then dozens and even more—each a perfect copy, holding the Swallow, their piercing gold eyes locked on Ryfel. The clones took a stance, their movements synchronized, ready to strike. The crowd erupted, their cheers a deafening roar as they recognized the Sovereign’s signature technique: The Spectacle of Ghosts.

Magic District Supporter (shouting, ecstatic):

“There it is! The Sovereign’s illusions! No one can stand against him!”



But Ryfel stood his ground, his eyes narrowing as he studied the mirrors. A smirk tugged at the corner of his mouth, a spark of defiance in his gaze. 



He raised his hands, light magic flickering at their tips, and spoke, his voice carrying across the arena.



Ryfel (calm, confident):

“I have studied you for a long time, Sovereign… especially how you do this.”



Before the crowd could process his words, Ryfel channeled his own magic into the glittering mirrors Aurex had set up. Light bent and refracted, and suddenly, Ryfel’s own clones began to appear on his side of the battlefield—dozens of Ryfels, each with similar armor and gauntlets, their stances mirroring against Aurex’s illusions. 



The arena fell into stunned silence for a heartbeat before exploding into chaos.

Kriscila (shocked, leaning forward):

“He… he’s using Aurex’s own technique against him!”



Bram (eyes wide open, shocked and laughing heartily):

“Hah! What the fuc- Ry! Who could have seen this coming?”



In the Magic District noble booth, Lux Solmere, the Bright Star of the Magic District, leaned forward, her silver hair catching the light. Her silver eyes widened, a mix of shock and curiosity flickering across her face as she whispered to herself.



Lux (quiet, analytical):

“He’s… copying Father’s technique? How? I could only get it half right! Who is this boy?”



Aurex himself stood amidst his clones, his piercing gold eyes narrowing slightly, a rare flicker of surprise crossing his face. But then his lips curled into a faint smile, his voice smooth and approving as he spoke, loud enough for Ryfel to hear.



Aurex (impressed, commanding):

“Truly impressive, Redimir boy… let’s see how far you can take this.”

With a wave of the Swallow, Aurex sent his clones forward, their movements a blur of precision. Ryfel responded in kind, his own clones charging to meet them. 

The battlefield became a chaotic collision of illusions—an army of Aurexes against an army of Ryfels, their weapons brawling in a symphony of clashes.

[CLANG! CLANG! CLANG!]

The crowd roared, unable to tell which fighters were real, as the clones mirrored each other’s strikes and dodges perfectly. It was a stalemate, a breathtaking display of magic and skill that left the coliseum in awe.

The clash of clones continued, neither side gaining ground, the battlefield a whirlwind of light and steel. 



But Aurex, ever the forward thinker, decided to shift the tide instantly.



He took a deep, mana-filled breath, his chest glowing faintly with magic, and exhaled a mist breath—a stream of air-laced water magic that spread across the arena like a shimmering veil. The mist thickened, cloaking the battlefield in a dense, silvery haze, and Aurex scattered more glitter into the air—fine reflective particles that caught the light, enhancing his illusions.



The mist and glitter worked their magic, amplifying Aurex’s clones. They became more lifelike, their movements no longer synchronized but independent, attacking Ryfel’s clones from different angles and timings. 



The symmetry of the stalemate broke in the silhouettes of the Silver Mist, as Aurex’s illusions outmaneuvered Ryfel’s—some of Ryfel’s clones were struck down, dissipating into bursts of light.



[FWOOSH!]



While others were hit by phantom strikes that seemed to come from nowhere.



Ryfel himself felt the shift, his senses overwhelmed as the real Aurex used the chaos to strike. A clone lunged from his left, but it was a feint—the real Swallow’s blade [SNKT!] grazed his arm from the right, drawing a thin line of blood.



Another phantom strike hit his leg, forcing him to stumble as he dodged a third attack from behind. The crowd gasped watching the mystified silhouettes fighting, the Magic District supporters cheering louder as Aurex took control of the fight.



Magic District Supporter (shouting, triumphant):

“The Sovereign’s mist! It’s over for the Farmland boy now!”

Dain (tense):
“Come on, Ryfel, you’ve got this!”

In the Magic District stands, Lux clasped her hands together, her silver eyes gleaming with pride as she watched her father dominate the battlefield.



Lux (quiet, proud):

“That’s Father’s true power… the mist makes his illusions unstoppable. How would he deal with it? How would I deal with it?”



Her gaze flickered to Ryfel in the shadows, her expression shifting to curiosity as she studied his every move, as if preparing for her own future battles.



Ryfel, meanwhile, gritted his teeth, his mind racing as he recognized the technique from Aurex’s fight with Garrik. He wouldn’t let the mist dictate the fight—not now, not ever.



Ryfel (gritted teeth, resolute):

“Not this time, Aurex.”



With a surge of resolve, Ryfel shot his grappling hooks deep into the earth, fortifying his position into the ground. He then proceeded to unleash a massive wind storm as the air around him began to swirl.



The wind gathered into a roaring tornado, its howl echoing across the arena as it tore through the battlefield. He added fine sand and pebbles into the mix, as the tornado swept up the mist and glitter. It not only scattered the reflective particles away but started to clear away the illusions in a matter of seconds. 



Aurex’s illusions were consistently struck, disappearing and reverting to where their movements became predictable again as the mist that fueled them dissipated, leaving the glittering mirrors exposed and ineffective.



Milal jumped up, her voice piercing through the roar of the crowd.



Milal (shouting, overjoyed and mocking):

“Sovereign my ass! Young Master cleared your famous technique with just a breeze!”



Ryker’s booming laughter echoed across the stands, his pride evident.



Ryker (proud, boisterous):

“Hahaha! Even I couldn’t have thought of that my boy!”



Elda’s eyes shone with quiet pride, her hands clasped tightly, while Grandpa Ironfoot finally cracked a small, approving smile.



Grandpa Ironfoot (gruff, impressed):

“Hmph… smart move, boy.”



Aurex stood amidst the fading illusions, his clones flickering out of existence as the mist vanished. 



His piercing gold eyes locked onto Ryfel, a faint smile tugging at his lips. He twirled the Swallow in his hands, the twin blades catching the light as he spoke, his voice smooth and approving.







Aurex (impressed, commanding):

“Impressive… In all my thirty years of fighting, no one has swept away my mist as fast as you. You’ve studied me well, Redimir.”



But the Sovereign of the Silver Mist wasn’t finished. His smile turned sharp, a glint of challenge in his gaze as he prepared to escalate the fight further.



Aurex (calm but cheeky):

“You will be the 4th person to have ‘witnessed’ this.”

With his mist and glitter disrupted, Aurex shifted tactics, activating a technique Ryfel hadn’t seen before.

He raised the Swallow, the twin blades glowing faintly as he channeled a new layer of magic. He then breathed a thin layer of mist forming around him, clinging to his shimmering armor like a second skin. 

The armor’s surface began to shift light, bending it around him with the help of the surrounding water vapor, until Aurex vanished completely from sight.

The crowd gasped as the Sovereign disappeared, his clones vanishing with him, leaving the battlefield eerily empty. 



Magic Noble (shouting, awestruck):

“Th-the Sovereign! He’s gone! That magic was a myth! How???”



Ryfel stood alone, his senses on high alert, his gauntlets raised as he scanned the arena for any sign of his opponent.



Ryfel (taken aback but excited):

“Even the tech back in America couldn’t do this. I can’t wait to learn it. 



But first, how do I deal with this?”



This was new—something Garrik hadn’t forced Aurex to reveal. 



Knowing he couldn’t fight what he couldn’t see, Ryfel went on the defensive, slamming his gauntlets into the ground to channel earth magic. A stone cage erupted around him, the walls thick and jagged, designed to block any incoming attacks.



But Aurex was too fast, too precise. The invisible Sovereign moved like a phantom, his speed allowing him to strike through the gaps in the cage. 



The Swallow’s twin blades [SNKT! SNKT!] hit Ryfel from unseen angles, a shallow cut across his shoulder, then another on his thigh. 



Ryfel grunted, his breathing heavy as he tried to track the attacks, but Aurex was nowhere and everywhere, his invisibility giving him the upper hand. The stone cage wasn’t working—Aurex’s speed and precision were too much. 



Ryfel’s mind flashed to a tactic he’d used before: escaping underground. He dropped to one knee and channeled earth magic to dive into the ground. 



The dirt parted around him swallowing him whole as he burrowed beneath the battlefield, hoping to buy time and reposition.

But Aurex wasn’t fooled. The Sovereign’s glittering mirrors, still embedded in the battlefield from the start of the fight, shimmered faintly as Ryfel moved beneath the surface.

The mirrors weren’t just for illusions—they were part of Aurex’s intricate tracking system, a marvel of Magic District craftsmanship. Tiny particles of glitter had clung to Ryfel during the earlier phases, each speck infused with a faint magical glow.

Now, the mirrors pulsed with light, sending delicate, shimmering threads of radiance through the ground—a network of luminous strands that wove together like a spider’s web, each thread connecting to the glitter on Ryfel’s body. 

The light bounced and refracted, tracing his every movement with unerring precision, revealing his exact location to Aurex as he burrowed beneath the earth.

Aurex’s piercing gold eyes, invisible to all, narrowed with focus. 

He raised the Swallow, the twin blades gleaming, and struck the ground with a precise, powerful thrust.

[CRACK!]

The blades cut through the earth like butter, the dirt splitting apart to reveal Ryfel mid-burrow. 

Before Ryfel could react, Aurex slashed downward, the Swallow’s edge catching him across the back, leaving a huge stinging gash. Ryfel grunted in pain, the force of the strike knocking him back to the surface as the ground split and erupted around him.

Bram (gasping, shocked):
“How the hell did he know where he was?! I couldn’t even find Ry when we fought!”

Ryfel rolled to his feet and threw up a quick earth cage around himself. His armor now marked with a fresh cut. He couldn’t escape underground—Aurex had countered his every move. 



He raised himself into a defensive stance, his mind racing for a new strategy.



Aurex’s voice echoed across the arena, smooth and commanding, his invisible form giving the words an eerie, disembodied quality.



Aurex (calm, taunting):

“You can’t hide from me, Redimir boy… my mirrors see everything.”



The Magic District stands erupted in cheers, their faith in the Sovereign unshaken. Lux Solmere leaned forward, her silver eyes gleaming with pride and curiosity.



Lux (quiet, impressed):

“Father’s mirrors… What did they even do?! I need to learn that!”

Ryfel’s mind continued racing, his body stinging from Aurex’s relentless attacks. He couldn’t see the Sovereign, he couldn’t block the strikes, and now, even escaping underground had failed. 

But Ryfel’s strength had always been his traps, and he wasn’t out of options yet. He took out certain and similar contraptions. Ones used against Bram.

He lowered parts of the stone cage partially and subtly slipped out his gadgets into the broken battlefield and shifted the earth beneath him, exposing himself just enough to tempt an attack.

He braced himself, ready to counter.

Aurex took the bait. The invisible Sovereign moved in, his speed a blur as he aimed the Swallow at Ryfel’s side. 

But as he stepped forward, his foot landed on one of Ryfel’s traps. 

[SQUELCH]

The sticky mine exploded, adhesive binding him in place. The invisibility flickered as Aurex’s concentration broke, his form shimmering back into view, his silver hair glinting in the light, his piercing gold eyes wide with surprise.

Aurex (surprised):

“What is this!?”



Ryfel seized the moment, bursting out of the cage with a surge of wind magic to close the distance.



The fight turned into a brutal close combat exchange, the two champions trading blows in a whirlwind of steel and magic.



Ryfel’s gauntlets blazed with earth and fire, striking at Aurex with a fiery fist, the heat grazing Aurex’s shoulder, leaving a scorch mark on his shimmering armor. 



Aurex countered swiftly, the Swallow’s twin blades spinning in a defensive arc, deflecting Ryfel’s next strike before slashing back [SNKT!], the blade nicking Ryfel’s forearm.



The back-and-forth continued, neither giving an inch. Ryfel ducked under a high strike from the Swallow, retaliating with a glowing uppercut, catching Aurex in the chest and forcing him to stagger back, the sticky trap stretching but still holding.



Aurex gritted his teeth, his gold eyes flashing with determination, and lunged forward despite the adhesive, the Swallow’s blades cutting across Ryfel’s thigh, drawing another thin line of blood. 



Ryfel grunted but pressed the attack, channeling hardened earth into his fists for a solid liver blow, knocking the air out of Aurex and cracking his ribs, as it connected with his side, sending him skidding a few meters, the sticky trap finally tearing free.



Although a battle hardened veteran, even legends bow to time’s relentless march. The liver blow Ryfel delivered—a concrete, precise strike—landed with such a devastating force leaving Aurex dire in the dust.



The crowd held its breath, the arena falling silent as the dust settled, both fighters breathing heavily, their armor scratched and bloodied from the intense exchange.



In the Magic District stands, Lux Solmere shot to her feet, her silver hair catching the light, her voice ringing out over the crowd with a mix of desperation and determination as she saw her father take hits for the first time in the fight.



Lux (shouting, passionate):

“Dad, I will hate you if you lose! You can only lose to me in the next tournament!”



Her words echoed through the coliseum, a raw declaration of her loyalty and ambition. The crowd murmured, some Magic District nobles chuckling at the Bright Star’s fiery spirit, while others were moved by her passion.



Aurex, still on one knee from Ryfel’s strike, looked up at Lux, his piercing gold eyes softening for a moment. Her words ignited a fire in him—he couldn’t let her down, not in front of the entire coliseum. He clenched his jaw, his resolve hardening as he rose to his feet, the Swallow still in his hands.



Aurex (quiet, determined):

“This old man won’t lose… not yet.”



Aurex’s armor began to glow, the shimmering plates emitting a blinding light that pulsed across the battlefield, forcing Ryfel to shield his eyes.



The Swallow, his twin-bladed spear, ignited with a radiant, cutting energy, the blades humming with power



[BZZZ! BZZZ!]



Their glow casting an ethereal light across the arena. 



Aurex channeled intense light and fire magic into the weapon, sending out swallow-shaped lights—bird-like projectiles of pure energy that streaked toward Ryfel from every angle, their speed and precision overwhelming.



The fight shifted into a brutal close and mid-range battle.



Aurex used his speed and the glowing Swallow to strike at Ryfel from close quarters, the blades slicing through the air with deadly intent.



[WOOM WOOM!]



Ryfel raised jagged stone walls and earth spikes to block the strikes, but the glowing blades cut through them with terrifying ease, the barriers only delaying the assault as chunks of stone shattered around him.



Ryfel barely dodged each strike, the heat of the radiant blades singeing his armor as they passed within inches of his skin.



At the same time, the swallow-shaped lights attacked from mid-range, forcing Ryfel to split his focus.



He summoned a thin sheet of water around himself, using water magic to refract the light-based projectiles.



The swallow-shaped lights bent as they passed through the water, but their trajectories only shifted slightly, missing Ryfel by mere inches. The energy birds grazed him as they streaked by, leaving stinging burns on his arms and legs, their heat searing his flesh bit by bit.



Ryfel (slowly breathless):

“Are you kidding me, how many attacks does this guy have?”



Bram (on the sidelines):

“Are you kidding me! How many attacks does this guy have?!?!”



The assault was relentless, a storm of light and heat was pushing Ryfel to his breaking point. 



The glowing Swallow clipped his shoulder [SNKT!], drawing mores lines of blood, while the light birds stung his legs and sides, leaving scorch marks and burns across his body. 



Ryfel gritted his teeth, his breathing ragged, as Aurex pressed the attack, his movements a blur of radiant energy, his silver hair a glowing streak in the chaos.



Ryfel (growling, frustrated):

“I’m done playing your game, Aurex!”

Pushed to his limits, Ryfel revealed his trump card.

Ryfel (done):

“I Fucked Around enough, but it’s time for you to Find Out!”



Ryfel raised his arms, priming his gauntlets. He had tested it out before in his workshop to quite a degree of success. However, it wasn’t as efficient as the weapons he used back in the land of the free.



The technology of this age is still limited, and even with ten years, this was the best Ryfel can perfect for now.



His revolver-style rifle already loaded. He cocked out the trigger mechanism from under his wrist.



Ryfel:

“Say hello to my little friend from America!”

Ryfel aimed at Aurex, his gaze unyielding, and fired.

The first bullet, made from earth, metal, and fire, streaked toward the Sovereign. 

[BANG!]

It slammed into his glowing armor with a resounding crack. The elemental magic shattered the shimmering plates, sending fragments of light scattering like broken glass. 

Aurex staggered, his radiant glow dimming as his last few parts of his armor broke, exposing his bare form to further attacks.

Aurex (intensely shocked):

“Wha-What the hell was that?”

Ryfel didn’t hesitate, he turned the barrel manually, firing again.

[BANG! BANG!]

The shots targeted the Swallow, striking the glowing twin blades with a force that reverberated through the arena. The impact ripped the spear from Aurex’s hands, the weapon skidding across the battlefield in a shower of sparks, its radiant energy fading as it landed in the dirt.

The Sovereign of the Silver Mist, the Three Time Reigning Champion, stood disarmed before a boy from Farmland—a boy who had easily conquered the entire tournament, was now on the verge of defeating the legend. 

Ryfel staggered, his body a canvas of battle—cuts and bruises marred his skin, burns from Aurex’s light attacks scorched his armor, and his breathing came in ragged gasps. 

His revolver-style gauntlets smoked faintly, the barrels still warm from their last shots,

In a last desperate attempt, Aurex tore off the final piece of his armor—a cracked shimmering chest plate—and hurled it into the air. 

Firing light into the plate, it glowed with a sudden, blinding flash, erupting into a massive flashbang that seared through the coliseum, disorienting Ryfel and the crowd alike. 

Bram (wincing in pain):
“Not again!” His eyes blinded too by Aurex.

Ryfel narrowly shielded his eyes,but his vision blurred as the light overwhelmed him. 

He stumbled, his balance faltering, his confidence shaken by the sudden assault. 

Aurex seized the moment, his speed a blur as he charged through the fading light, closing the distance in an instant. 

With a powerful tackle, he knocked Ryfel off his feet, sending him crashing to the ground, Aurex then grabbed his revolver-style gauntlets, wrenching them from Ryfel’s arms with a forceful twist, and tossed them aside, disarming Ryfel as well.

Aurex (gritting his teeth, fierce):
“If I fall, I’ll fall as a champion, Redimir!!”

Ryfel rolled to his feet, his body screaming in pain. He raised his bare fists, gauntlets gone, leaving him as weaponless as Aurex. 

He took a step forward, his voice rough but filled with admiration.  

Ryfel (earnest):
“I’ve heard about you since I was a kid, Aurex.”

He wiped blood from his lip, his gaze steady.  

“Went to every district, asking about your fights of the past 40 years. 

They said you barely used magic back then—started with mostly just brawling.”

He squared his shoulders, cracked his neck.  

Ryfel (proposing):
“What do you say, Champion? Bare hands. Finish it like your old times?”

Aurex’s gold eyes widened for a moment, a spark of recognition in his gaze. He tilted his head back and laughed, his expression softening as he spoke.  

Aurex (reflective):  
“Forty years… I’ve changed a lot since then, Redim- no… Ryfel.”

He chuckled softly, changing his tone to respect.  

Aurex (reminiscing):  
“Became a noble, had a family, got more gear, more prestige—built this whole fighting style.”

Then, his chuckle grew into a hearty, booming laugh that echoed through the coliseum, a sound of pure, unbridled joy as he threw his head back once more.  

Aurex (laughing heartily):  
“You are right… this is who I was! And this is how I will end it!”



In agreement, they shed the last remnants of their armor—Ryfel unstrapping his cracked chest plate, Aurex removing his tattered shoulder guards—revealing their bodies to the arena. 

Aurex, though older, stood as a testament to a champion’s enduring strength, his frame still rippling with muscle, his silver hair framing a battered physique honed by decades of battle. 

Ryfel, young but forged in the fires of hardship, bore the fruits of his journey, his lean, chiseled body a canvas of consistent hard work, brimming with the raw power of youth.

The crowd gasped, their murmurs rippling through the stands. In the Farmland team’s section, Kriscila’s eyes widened, her cheeks flushing slightly as she whispered to herself.

Kriscila (murmuring, awestruck):  
“Ryfel… he’s grown so- oh wow… his body…”



The two fighters raised their fists, their gazes locked, a mutual respect passing between them like a silent vow. There would be no magic in this final clash—only the raw, unfiltered strength of their bodies and wills. 

They charged, their fists flying in a brutal hand-to-hand brawl that shook the arena with admiration.  

Aurex struck first, a powerful right hook that caught Ryfel’s jaw, drawing blood. 

Ryfel retaliated with a swift jab to Aurex’s chest the impact forcing a grunt from the Sovereign. 

They traded blows with relentless ferocity, each punch a testament to their unyielding spirits. 

The crowd roared, their cheers a unified chant of “Sovereign! Redimir!”, their voices echoing through the coliseum as they celebrated the clash of two titans.  

Magic District Supporter (cheering, reverent):  
“Fight, Sovereign! You’re still our champion!”

As the brawl wore on, their bodies glistening with sweat, their breathing ragged, but neither would yield. Ryfel delivered a series of liver blows, each one a thunderous strike—first to Aurex’s left side, then to his right.

Aurex grunted, his body trembling under the onslaught, but his gold eyes burned with pride, refusing to fall without a fight.

As Aurex threw a final, desperate punch, Ryfel ducked. He channeled every ounce of his strength left right into the champion’s solar plexus, the force sending a shockwave through the arena, the ground trembling beneath their feet.  

Aurex, a battle-hardened veteran whose name echoed through the tournament’s history, who had long reigned untouchable, his silver hair a crown of unblemished victories.

Yet even legends bow to time’s relentless march, his body finally gave out.  

As Aurex fell, Ryfel staggered, his chest heaving. He looked down at the fallen champion, his voice steady despite his exhaustion, echoing the respect he felt for the man who had pushed him to his limits.  

Ryfel (soft, reverent):  
“Take pride, Aurex… For these 40 years, you were the strongest.”

Aurex’s gold eyes met Ryfel’s, a faint smile spreading across his face, a mix of pride and peace.

The gong rang out, its deep echo cutting through the roar of the crowd, signaling the end of the fight. 

The Tournament Official’s voice boomed over the coliseum, the words etching themselves into history.  

Tournament Official (shouting, commanding):  
“Ryfel Redimir of Farmland is the new Contender Champion!”



The coliseum erupted into a frenzy of cheers, a tidal wave of sound that shook the very foundations of the arena. 



Green banners waved furiously as the Farmland district exploded with pride, their shouts and chants a unified roar of triumph. 



The entire arena buzzed with joy, fans from all five districts rising to their feet, clapping and cheering for the rise of a new champion—Ryfel Redimir, the boy from Farmland who had toppled a legend. 



Even the Magic District supporters, though somber for their fallen Sovereign, joined in the applause, their silver flags waving in respectful acknowledgment of the historic fight they had witnessed.



The Farmland team couldn’t contain themselves any longer. 



Kriscila, Dain, and Bram leapt over the barrier separating the stands from the arena, their faces alight with joy as they sprinted toward Ryfel. Behind them, a wave of Farmland supporters followed, their green cloaks and banners streaming like a river of emerald as they flooded the battlefield, their cheers echoing through the coliseum.



Kriscila (laughing, overjoyed):

“Ryfel! You did it! You’re the champion!”



Kriscila reached him first, throwing her arms around him in a tight hug, tears of happiness streaming down her face. Dain and Bram were right behind her, grabbing Ryfel by the shoulders and hoisting him up, their grins wide and unrestrained.



Dain (proud, beaming):

“That’s our freaking leader! You are Farmland’s champion!”



Bram (roaring, ecstatic):

“A damn legend, Ry! You’re a dam fucking legend!”



The Farmland supporters swarmed around them, lifting Ryfel onto their shoulders, blood and sweat flying everywhere, their chants of “Redimir! Redimir!” shaking the arena.



They paraded him around the battlefield, their voices a symphony of pride and victory, green banners waving high above their heads.



Ryfel, still catching his breath, managed a tired but triumphant smile, raising a fist in acknowledgment as the crowd’s cheers grew even louder.



In the nobles’ booth, Ryker, Elda, and Milal were a whirlwind of emotion, their reactions a mix of unrestrained joy and disbelief. Ryker threw his head back, his booming laughter echoing over the stands as he slammed his fists on the railing, his face red with pride.



Ryker (boisterous, triumphant):

“That’s my son! That is my son! That is MY SON!”



Elda clutched her chest, tears streaming down her face as she laughed and cried at the same time, her voice trembling with emotion.



Elda (sobbing, overjoyed):

“My boy… my little Ryfel… you’ve done it…”



Milal, unable to contain herself, jumped up and down flinging her sticks and skewers everywhere, her screams piercing through the noise of the crowd as she waved her arms wildly.



Milal (screaming, ecstatic):

“Young Master Ryfel! I knew it!!! I always knew you could do it!”



The other nobles in the booth, usually composed and reserved, were caught up in the infectious energy, clapping and cheering alongside Ryker, Elda, and Milal. Some raised their goblets in a toast chugging down their wine, their voices joining the cacophony of celebration.



Farmland Noble (cheering, impressed):

“Our District will now lead the Outer Courts!”



In the Magic District stands, Lux had already dashed to the arena and knelt beside her father, her silver eyes filled with a mix of pride and determination as she helped Aurex sit up.



She gave him the tightest hug she could.



Lux (crying):

“Father… You were great, you were the best! And I will always love you!



You fought like a true champion, Father… And I’ll carry your legacy forward.”



Aurex (comforting):

“I love you too my child. 



Don’t focus on my legacy, you have to build yours. And I will always be here with you to do it.”



The entire arena buzzed with joy, the air electric with the thrill of a new era. Fans from all districts clapped and cheered, their voices a unified celebration of Ryfel’s victory and Aurex’s legacy.



In the Farmland nobles’ booth, Ryker’s pride reached a fever pitch.



With booming laughter, he leapt over the railing, landing in the announcer’s platform.



The Tournament Official stepped back, startled, as Ryker took his place, his presence commanding the attention of the entire coliseum. He raised a foot and stomped the ground with a mighty boom, channeling his earth magic to raise a towering platform of stone from the stands, elevating him high above the arena.



The crowd gasped, their cheers growing louder as Ryker’s voice roared over the coliseum, his tone brimming with triumph and hospitality.



Ryker (boisterous, inviting):

“Those who wish to celebrate with us! Farmland opens its gates to you—from the wall to the courts! We’ll celebrate with a festival to honor our new champion! WE WELCOME ALL!”



The coliseum erupted once more, the crowd’s cheers reaching a deafening crescendo as fans from every district waved their banners—green for Farmland, silver for Magic District, and every color in between—united in the promise of celebration.



Ryfel, still on the shoulders of his Farmland supporters, looked up at his father with a tired but proud smile, his heart swelling at the sight of the districts coming together.



As the sun dipped below the horizon, casting a golden glow over the coliseum, the crowd began to disperse, their voices buzzing with excitement for the night ahead.



Farmland’s victory would be celebrated under the stars, a festival that would mark the beginning of a new era—and the dawn of Ryfel Redimir’s legacy as champion.
