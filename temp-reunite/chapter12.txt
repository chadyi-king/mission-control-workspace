Chapter 12: The Path Forward

The Farmland Festival

The festival began almost immediately, spilling out from the arena into the cobblestone streets of Farmland. 

Lanterns were strung up in a hurry, their golden glow casting flickering shadows over the district. Stalls sprang to life, their wooden frames laden with sizzling skewers, honey-dripped tarts, and barrels of frothy ale.

Lutes and drums struck up a lively tune, and the air filled with the scent of roasted meat and the sound of laughter. Children darted through the crowd, waving ribbons, while dancers spun in circles around crackling bonfires.

Ryker led the way, his booming laughter drawing smiles from everyone nearby. Elda walked beside him, her hand tucked into the crook of his arm. Milal followed close behind, already eyeing the food stalls with a grin, while Ryfel’s team—Kriscila, Dain, and Bram—trailed after, their voices loud with excitement. 



Grandpa Ironfoot brought up the rear, his grizzled face red with pride as he shouted at anyone who’d listen about his grandson’s fight.



Lux and Aurex lingered at the edge of the group, their silver hair catching the firelight as they observed the festivities with a mix of curiosity and reserve.



Ryker [leading the group]

“Come on, come on! To our estate! We’ll have a party—a proper one! Redimirs don’t celebrate small!”



[BOOM of his voice over the crowd]



The cobblestone streets of Farmland were packed with revelers, the air thick with the scent of roasted meat and the sound of lutes and drums.



As Ryfel passed, the people of Farmland—farmers, blacksmiths, and shopkeepers—turned to him, their faces alight with pride. A burly farmer with a straw hat stepped forward, clapping Ryfel on the shoulder hard enough to make him stumble.



Farmer:

“Ryfel, lad! You’ve done us proud—prouder than a prize bull at the fair! Farmland’s never seen a champion like you!”



A young girl with pigtails darted out from the crowd, holding up a ribbon tied into a clumsy bow. “For you, Ryfel!” she squeaked, her cheeks red with excitement, before running back to her group of friends, who all waved at Ryfel with a beaming smile.



An old blacksmith, his apron still smudged with soot, raised his mug of ale as Ryfel passed. 



Old Blacksmith:

“To Ryfel Redimir—may your traps never fail!”



The congratulations continued as the group moved through the festival, the crowd’s energy infectious.



A group of farmers near a bonfire started chanting Ryfel’s name—“Ry-fel! Ry-fel! Ry-fel!”—their voices rising over the music, their fists pumping in the air.



Ryfel’s chest swelled with every shout, every smile, the weight of the tournament lifting with each step. He glanced at Kriscila, who was grinning at him, her chains glinting in the lantern light, her expression red with a mix of pride and something softer he couldn’t quite place.



They reached the open area near the district’s outer wall, close to the Redimir estate, where a large party was already in full swing. The estate loomed nearby, its stone walls draped in ivy, its windows glowing with candlelight from within. A massive bonfire roared in the clearing, surrounded by wooden benches and tables laden with food and drink—roasted meats, fresh bread, and barrels of ale.



The crowd here was a mix of Farmland’s people and visitors: nobles in silken cloaks mingled with commoners in patched tunics, their laughter blending with the music of lutes and drums.



The Farmland District’s doors were thrown open from the front gates to the Lord’s estate, welcoming everyone, and the air buzzed with the energy of celebration.



Ryker spread his arms wide as they entered the clearing, his voice carrying over the crowd, his face red with excitement.



Ryker (spreading his arms):



“Here we are! Redimir estate, best spot in Farmland! 



Let’s celebrate! For my boy’s a champion! And to us taking the Head of the Outer Courts for the first time!”



Elda smiled softly, her hand resting on Ryker’s arm as she looked out at the gathered crowd, her auburn hair catching the firelight. She gestured for Ryfel to join her near the bonfire, where a group of nobles and commoners had gathered, their mugs raised in toast.



Elda:

“My boy… come here… let them see you… Farmland’s champion…”



Ryfel stepped forward slowly, tired but happy, as the crowd’s cheers washed over him. A noble in an emerald-trimmed cloak raised his mug, his voice smooth but genuine.



Noble (raising his mug):

“To Ryfel Redimir—Farmland’s pride! Your victories will bring glory to us as we can finally rule in the Outer Courts!”



Milal, meanwhile, had dragged Kriscila toward a table near the estate’s gates, where a barrel of ale sat surrounded by mugs. She filled two mugs to the brim, her grin wide as she handed one to Kriscila.



Milal (handing Kriscila a mug):

“Drink up, Kriscila! Young Master’s a champion, and we’re gonna party like Redimirs—party!”



Kriscila (taking the mug):

“Oh my, my parents have never let me try this before. But thank you Milal, I will accept your offer.”



Kriscila downed the ale in one go, her cheeks flushing red almost immediately, her laughter gradually getting louder as Milal refilled her mug with a mischievous smirk.



“Heh… Hehehe… Hahahaha! HAHAHA! Milal! This is soooooo tasty! Shooooo good. 



And that daaaam Ryfel, mmmmm he is shoooo good too.”



Milal (shocked and awed):

“That was…quick! You are such a lightweight Kriscila! Hahaha



And don't you worry, we all know what you feel about our Young Master here at Redimir! We aaaaall approve!”



The two clinked their mugs together, their voices blending with the music as they toasted again.



Near the bonfire, Bram and Dain had found a table piled with skewers, their competitive spirits already flaring. Bram grabbed a bunch of skewers and he waved it at Dain, his grin wide.



Bram [waving multiple skewers]

“Hoooo shiiiiiit! Let’s eat, Dain—eat! I’m takin’ ten tonight—ten! You in, or you scared—scared?”



Dain [grunting]

“You’ll choke before five, Bram. Yooou fool… but I’m in, can’t let you show me up.”



The two started eating, their laughter muffled by mouthfuls of meat, while a small crowd of commoners gathered around, cheering them on. Grandpa Ironfoot wiggled and stomped through the crowd, his heavy boots stomping on the ground, his eyes glinting as he spotted Milal and Kriscila by the ale barrel.



Grandpa Ironfoot (grinning and shouting)

“Oi, girlie! Heard you talking shit for the booths! Think you’re hot stuff, huh? Let’s see if you can keep up with an Ironfoot—skewer contest, right here—right now!”



Milal spun around, her mug still in hand, her smirk sharp as she pointed at Grandpa Ironfoot, her voice cutting through the crowd’s cheers.



Milal (pointing and half drunk):

“Hah! Shuuuuut it, old man! You wanna challenge a Redimir? Heh! I have my own record of 132 Skewers! I will fight all 3 of you! Let’s go go go!”



The crowd around them grew, nobles and commoners alike gathering to watch, their laughter rising as Milal, Grandpa Ironfoot, Bram and Dain grabbed skewers from the nearby cart, their contest beginning with a flurry of bites. Ryker clapped his hands, his laughter booming as he egged them on, his face red with joy.



Ryker [clapping]

“That’s the spirit! Show ‘em, Milal! And Ironfoots, you’re gonna regret her appetite!”





The Champion and his Daughter


Lux and Aurex stood near the estate’s gates, their silver hair glinting in the firelight as they watched the party unfold. Lux’s gold eyes followed Ryfel, her expression a mix of curiosity and respect, while Aurex sat beside her, his tall frame casting a shadow over the cobblestones.



Lux (pouting):

“Well I wanted you to retire Father, but it was when I was the one to beat you.”



Lux’s voice was low, almost lost in the music, but there was a sharpness to her tone, a flicker of frustration beneath her calm exterior. She crossed her arms, her gold eyes narrowing slightly as she watched Ryfel laugh with his team near the bonfire, his easy smile a stark contrast to her own intensity.



Aurex (smiling):

“I know, my Luxy, I was waiting for that day too… you’re not just my Bright Star, but the district’s too… the way you shine—not just as a fighter, but a performer—you draw in so many types of supporters…”



Aurex’s smile was warm, his deep voice carrying a quiet pride as he leaned back against the estate’s wall, his silver cloak pooling around him.



Lux (softening):

“A performer… I love doing that too… But I feel like my focus was split… 



If I focused on fighting, maybe I could have been the one there today instead?”



Lux’s tone softened, her gold eyes flickering with a rare vulnerability as she looked at her father, her arms uncrossing slightly. The firelight caught the shimmer of her silver hair, and for a moment, she seemed vulnerable, less guarded, the weight of her ambitions lifting under her Father’s words.



Aurex [nodding]

“I do, Luxy—I do think of that too… But I didnt want you to follow in my ways where I was  too absorbed in winning and fighting and helping the nobles rule…



To me it was a mistake that caused me your mother, my beautiful wife.



And I don’t want to make the same mistake again… I’ll always be here for you to let you enjoy what you want to do—always…”



Aurex’s voice grew quieter, his smile fading into a more somber expression as he spoke, his eyes distant for a moment, lost in memory. He reached out, resting a hand on Lux’s shoulder, his touch gentle but firm, a silent promise in his grip.



Lux (looking down):

“I miss her too, Father… I know you’ve always been there… even when I push too hard… thank you…”



Lux’s gaze dropped to the cobblestones, her voice barely above a whisper, the music and laughter of the party fading into the background for a moment. She placed her hand over his, her fingers small against her father’s weathered palm, and a small, grateful smile tugged at her lips before she looked up again, her focus returning to Ryfel.



Lux (thoughtful):

“I do respect the new champion, Ryfel… We are the same age, and he already beat you at your best, Father… 



Would making acquaintance with him help the standing of our Magic District…?”



Lux’s tone shifted, her gold eyes narrowing with calculation as she watched Ryfel, her mind already racing with possibilities. She brushed a strand of silver hair behind her ear, her posture straightening as she considered the political implications of Ryfel’s victory.



Aurex (chuckling):

“Hah! A smart move—a devious one… yes, Luxy, it would… 



Farmland’s rising, and Ryfel’s at the heart of it… an alliance could strengthen our districts, taking the fight to the Inner Courts.”



Aurex’s chuckle was soft, his eyes crinkling at the corners as he took a sip from the mug of ale he’d been holding, the foam clinging to his moustache. He set the mug down on the ground, the faint clink of wood against stone barely audible over the music, and leaned closer, his voice dropping to a conspiratorial whisper.



Aurex (teasing):

“Hmmm hmmm? Is my little girl finally interested in a boy…?”



Aurex’s tone turned playful, a mischievous glint in his eyes as he raised an eyebrow at Lux, his smile widening. He nudged her gently with his elbow.



Lux (blushing):

“No—no! I… just… maybe… I don’t know… respect…?”



Lux’s cheeks flushed a deep red, her gold eyes widening as she stammered, her usual composure crumbling under her father’s teasing.



She turned her face away, her silver hair falling over her shoulder to hide her blush, but the faint smile on her lips betrayed her, a mix of embarrassment and amusement.



Aurex (laughing):

“Haha! Respect, she says—respect! I know that look, Luxy—I know it, it’s the same like how I saw your mother do it… but I’ll let you have your secrets—for now!”

Aurex’s laughter echoed through the clearing, drawing a few curious glances from nearby nobles, who smiled at the sight of the legendary Sovereign of the Silver Mist so at ease.

Lux shook her head, her blush fading as she rolled her eyes, but the small smile lingered on her lips, her gaze softening as she looked at Ryfel.



Two New Surprises

Ryker pulled Ryfel aside towards Elda, away from the growing crowd around the skewer contest, his hand gripping Ryfel’s shoulder. His excitement was palpable, his eyes shining like the lanterns overhead.



Ryker (pulling Ryfel aside, grinng):

“We’ve got big news, my boy! 



First of all, I need you to know how proud we both are. 



You didn’t just fulfill my dream, but you’ve also given Farmland a chance to push for policy changes that will benefit everyone. The nobles can’t stop talking about it!”



Ryker’s voice boomed over the music, his grin wide as he clapped Ryfel on the back, nearly knocking him forward. Both he and Ryfel gestured toward a group of nobles near the bonfire, their silken cloaks glinting as they raised their mugs in Ryfel’s direction, their faces alight with ambition and celebration.



Ryker (beaming):

“It’s a new beginning for our district! And beyond that, a new beginning for all of us as a family too! 



We have two surprises for you. Would you like to guess?”



Ryker’s excitement was infectious, his hands gesturing wildly as he spoke, his voice rising with enthusiasm. He glanced at Elda, who was watching from a bench near the bonfire.



Elda (smiling):

“Oh don’t tease him like that Ry, our Little Ry has been through such a tiring day!”



Elda’s hand shifted resting on her belly, her smile radiant in the firelight.



“You are going to be a brother Little Ry! 



We didn’t want to worry you since you were so focused on the tournament, but we’ve known this news for three months now. We couldn’t wait to share it with you, whether you won or lost.”



Ryfel (eyes widening):

“I’m going to be… A brother? You mean Mother’s pregnant? That’s amazing, Father! I’m so happy for us—congratulations!”



Ryfel’s eyes widened, joy surging through him like a wave, his voice brimming with excitement as he looked between his parents. He stepped toward Elda, his smile bright enough to rival the bonfire, his heart racing with the thought of a new sibling.



Elda’s eyes shimmered with unshed tears, her smile warm and full of love as she looked at her son.



Ryfel (beaming):

“Three months… you kept it a secret that long? I can’t believe it—I’m so happy, Mother! But wait, Father said two surprises. What’s the other one?”



Ryfel’s excitement bubbled over, his voice filled with eager curiosity as he turned back to Ryker, his hands fidgeting at his sides. The thought of another surprise sent a thrill through him, his mind racing with possibilities.



Elda (clarifying):

“Two surprises, my boy, because it’s not just me. Milal is pregnant too—both with your father’s children. You’ll have two new siblings.”



Elda’s smile widened as she gestured toward Milal, who was still locked in her skewer-eating contest near the bonfire, her laughter ringing out over the crowd. The firelight caught the joy in Elda’s eyes, her voice steady but filled with warmth as she shared the full extent of the news.



Ryfel (grinning):

“Two siblings… that’s incredible! 



I’m so happy—truly happy! Congratulations to you both—and to Milal too!”



Ryfel’s grin stretched ear to ear, his heart swelling with happiness as he looked between his parents and then at Milal, who waved at him from the contest, her mouth full of skewer but her eyes bright with shared joy.



The news settled into him, a double blessing that made the night even more special.



He paused for a moment, his mind briefly reflecting on the cultural norms of this world—where polygamy was accepted, where a man like Ryker could have a wife but also other women, like Milal, and it was celebrated as a sign of strength and unity. 



It was different from the world he’d once known, but here, it felt right, a part of the life he’d come to love.



Farmland Commoner (counting):

“One hundred and fifty five! The winner of the Skewer Eating Contest, Milal of House Redimir!”

Grandpa Ironfoot slumped over the table, his grizzled moustache flecked with grease, his tiny chest heaving as he tried to catch his breath. 

His face was pale, his belly bloated from the skewer-eating contest, and he looked like he might keel over at any moment.

Beside him, Bram and Dain were already passed out, their heads resting on the table amidst a pile of empty skewers, their snores barely audible over the music of the festival. 

Grandpa Ironfoot (struggling to take a breath):

“Hooooly shit, these Redimirs are all monsters, I thought she was kidding about the 132 skewer record.”

The crowd around them cheered and laughed, some patting Milal on the back as she stood victorious, her hands on her hips, basking in her win.

Milal scoots on over to the family, chomping down on her last skewer, Kriscila stumbled behind her, her cheeks flushed a deep red from the ale Milal had plied her with earlier.

Milal (excited):
“Hehehe, I guess you told him already Ma’am! See thats why I gotta eat 33 more skewers for an extra someone growing in me!”

Elda:
“Milal, I know you have to eat a lot because you burn so much energy, but please… don’t fight so much these days. You have your own child to protect now.”

As the family banters and bickers, the drunken Kriscila grabs Ryfel by the hand and takes him away, where fewer can hear.

Milal (snickering):
“Oooooooh, hehehe she is finally going to do it!”

Milal’s voice carried over the crowd, her snicker sharp and knowing as she nudged Elda, her grin widening. 

Both women’s faces curled into the same devious smile, their eyes glinting with mischief as they giggled together, their expressions mirroring each other perfectly. They looked like a pair of gossiping matchmakers, their laughter soft but conspiratorial, as if they’d planned this moment all along.

Ryker (stepping back):
“Wew, you woman are truly scary when it comes to something like this.”

Ryker took a step back, raising his hands in mock surrender, his booming laugh echoing through the clearing.





Kriscila stopped near the wall, her hands still holding Ryfel’s, though her grip loosened as she looked down at the ground, her cheeks burning redder than the bonfire’s glow. 

The lantern light above them cast a soft sheen over her face, highlighting the nervous flutter of her eyelashes, her chains glinting faintly as she shifted her weight from one foot to the other. 

She bit her lip, her breath uneven, the ale making her bolder but not enough to erase her shyness.

Kriscila (shyly):

“Ryfel… I… I need to tell you something. It’s… it’s been on my mind for a while, and I… I can’t keep it in anymore…”



Kriscila’s voice was soft, almost a whisper, her words halting as she glanced up at him briefly before looking away again, her hands fidgeting with his. Her usual fiery energy was muted, replaced by a quiet vulnerability that made her seem smaller, more fragile in the lantern’s glow.



Ryfel (gentle):

“What is it, Kriscila? You can tell me.”



Ryfel’s tone was gentle, his expression warm as he gave her hand a reassuring squeeze, his eyes steady on hers despite her avoidance. He stood still, the sounds of the festival fading further as he focused on her, sensing the importance of her words.

Kriscila (nervous):
“Ever since we were kids… you saved me when Dain and his brothers bullied me into the alley. 

Even when I got too reckless during the trials, when you kept protecting me… I realized it more then…”

Kriscila’s voice trembled, her words coming out in a rush as she finally met his gaze, her bright and beautiful eyes wide and shimmering with unshed tears. She took a shaky breath, her hands tightening around his as she continued, her voice barely above a whisper.



Kriscila (softly):

“After those times… I started to see… I looked up to you not just as a leader, but… but as something more… I… I don’t know how to say it, but… 



I… I really like you…



I… I like you, Ryfel. I really do… I thi-think I’ve always liked you, ever since we were kids…”

Kriscila’s cheeks burned even brighter, her gaze dropping to the ground again as she finished, her shoulders hunching slightly as if bracing for his response. 

Her chains jingled softly with her trembling, the lantern light catching the vulnerability in her expression, her heart laid bare in the quiet space they’d found.







GAP NOT SURE YET











Ryfel’s voice softened, his eyes warm with sincerity as he spoke, his thumb brushing gently over the back of her hand to comfort her.



He paused, his own cheeks flushing slightly as he looked at her, his heart racing with the weight of his own admission. He took a deep breath, his expression turning more serious as he continued, his tone careful but earnest.



Ryfel (thoughtful):

“But… we’re still young, Kriscila, and there are so many challenges ahead. The trials showed me how much I have to grow as a leader—not just for Farmland, but for our team… and actually maybe even us.



I want to be someone you can rely on not just once or twice, but always. Someone who can protect you and everyone else, no matter what comes our way.”



Ryfel’s gaze softened further, his free hand reaching up to gently tuck a stray strand of hair behind her ear, his touch light but steady.



He smiled faintly, a mix of affection and determination in his eyes, his voice lowering as he shared his hopes for the future.



Ryfel (hopeful):

“And actually also, we aren’t adults yet. In three years, we would be and when things are calmer… when I’ve become the leader I need to be… we can be together.



I want to do this right, Kriscila—for both of us. I want to be ready… for you.”

Ryfel’s voice started shaking, his cheeks flushing a deep red as he stumbled over his words, his usual composure slipping in the face of his own vulnerability. He glanced down at their joined hands, his thumb brushing nervously over her knuckles, his heart racing as he tried to explain himself. He took a shaky breath, his gaze lifting to meet hers again, a mix of determination and nervousness in his eyes.

Ryfel (flustered):

“I just want to let you know that these three years thing is not a cop out. I still want you beside me, around me, next to me. Helping me fight and flourish.



I just won’t… you know… be able to touch you. No-not in that way but more like displaying physical affection yet.



I am quite serious, Kriscila… but maybe to show you that… Here.”



Ryfel’s voice softened to a near whisper, his resolve steadying as he leaned in slowly, giving her time to pull away if she wanted. Kriscila’s breath hitched, her wide eyes meeting his for a fleeting moment before fluttering shut, her lips parting slightly in anticipation.



Ryfel closed the distance, his lips brushing against hers in a gentle, tentative kiss, the touch light but filled with a quiet intensity that made both their hearts skip a beat. 



The world around them seemed to fade—the festival’s music, the laughter, the crackle of the bonfire—all of it melted away, leaving only the warmth of their shared breath and the soft press of their lips.



Kriscila’s cheeks burned even brighter, her hands trembling in his as she kissed him back, her response shy but earnest, the ale in her system making her a little bolder despite her flustered state.



Ryfel pulled back after a moment, his own face flushed a deep crimson, his breath uneven as he looked at her, his eyes wide with a mix of awe and nervousness. Kriscila’s eyes fluttered open, her gaze hazy from the ale and the kiss, a shy smile tugging at her lips as she touched her fingers to her mouth, her heart racing so fast she could barely think.



Kriscila (flustered):

“R-Ryfel… I… that was… I…”



Kriscila’s words stumbled over each other, her voice barely above a whisper as she looked at him, her cheeks glowing with a mix of embarrassment and joy. She swayed slightly, the ale making her a bit unsteady on her feet, her chains jingling softly as she tried to steady herself, her smile growing despite her flustered state.



Ryfel (smiling softly):

“Come on… I know you’ve had a bit too much to drink. Let’s get you back to my Mother so you can rest.”



Ryfel’s smile was soft, his own flustered expression giving way to a gentle warmth as he slipped an arm around her shoulders, steadying her as they walked back toward the main clearing. Kriscila leaned into him, her steps wobbly but her heart lighter than it had ever been, her shy smile lingering as she glanced up at him, her eyes half-lidded from the ale and the whirlwind of emotions.



They reached the bonfire where Elda was still sitting, her hair glowing in the firelight as she chatted with a few nobles, her hand resting on her belly. She looked up as Ryfel approached, her eyes softening with understanding as she noticed Kriscila’s flushed cheeks and the way she clung to Ryfel’s arm, her smile a little too dreamy for just the ale.



Elda (gentle):

“Oh, Kriscila… you’ve had quite the night, haven’t you? Let’s get you inside to rest.”



Elda stood, her movements graceful despite her pregnancy, and took Kriscila’s other arm, guiding her toward the Redimir estate’s open gates. 



Kriscila mumbled something incoherent, her head lolling slightly as she leaned against Elda, her smile never fading. Ryfel followed them to the entrance, his heart full as he watched Elda lead Kriscila inside, the girl’s steps slow and sleepy.



As they reached a small guest room just off the main hall, Elda helped Kriscila onto a cot, pulling a soft blanket over her. 



Kriscila’s eyes fluttered shut, her smile lingering even as she drifted off to sleep, her breathing evening out as the warmth of the blanket and the events of the night lulled her into a peaceful slumber. Elda brushed a strand of hair from Kriscila’s face, her own smile tender as she glanced back at Ryfel, who stood in the doorway.



Elda (whispering):

“She’ll be fine after some rest… you did well, my boy.”



Ryfel nodded, his gaze lingering on Kriscila’s sleeping form, her peaceful expression filling him with a quiet joy. 



The news of his new siblings had been the first surprise of the night, but this moment—Kriscila’s confession, their kiss, and the promise of a future together—felt like the second, and it filled his heart with a joy that rivaled even his victory in the tournament. He turned back toward the festival, the music and laughter calling him to rejoin the celebration, his steps lighter than they’d ever been.



Redemption

The festival at the Redimir estate glowed with life, the bonfire casting flickering shadows over the clearing as the music of lutes and drums filled the air. Near the fire, a long table held the remnants of the skewer-eating contest—empty mugs and scattered skewers. 



Grandpa Ironfoot slumped in his chair, muttering to himself, while Bram snored beside him, his head on the table.



Dain (groaning):

“Ugh… never again… my stomach’s gonna kill me…”



Dain stirred, his stomach aching from overeating, He suddenly noticed his father Lards and his brothers Ham and Tarby standing near the edge of the clearing, their silhouettes framed by the firelight.



Dain (hesitant):

“Pa… Sorry I mean Father… Ham, Tarby… I-I didn’t think you’d come tonight…”



Dain stood, his legs shaky, and walked over to his family, his hands fidgeting. Lards turned, his gray beard catching the light, while Ham, the larger, heavier brother, and Tarby, the quieter fat one, straightened, their expressions a mix of scrutiny and faint pride.



Lards (gruff):

“We came for Farmland, Dain… and for you. We saw you out there with the Redimir boy… you fought well… better than I expected, I’ll give you that…”



Lards’ voice was rough, his tone carrying a hint of praise, but his gray eyes narrowed as he studied his son, his noble tunic slightly askew from the night’s festivities. Dain’s shoulders relaxed slightly, a flicker of hope in his chest at his father’s words, but the moment was short-lived.



Lards (critical):

“But you still lost, Dain… you didn’t win the tournament.



You can do better—much better. You’re a Luthren… I fought with Ryker back in the day, and I never settled for second place. You need to beat that Redimir boy next time… show him who’s really the best…”



Ham (mocking):

“Yeah, exactly… you fought good, Dain, I’ll give you that… but losing to Ryfel?



Come on, little brother… you’re better than that. You should’ve taken him down out there… you could’ve been the leader of that team if you’d just pushed harder…”



Ham’s voice was loud, his heavy frame looming as he stepped closer, his round face flushed from the ale he’d been drinking. He clapped a meaty hand on Dain’s shoulder, the gesture more forceful than comforting, his tone dripping with mockery as he continued.



Ham (insistent):

“You’ve got the skill, Dain… we all saw it. But you let Ryfel take the spotlight… again.



You wanna be the best, you gotta take him out—beat him, show everyone a Luthren’s the real champion… you can still be the leader, you know… just get Ryfel out of the way…”



Dain froze, unable to speak.



Ham (taunting):

“What’s wrong, Dain? You’re not even saying anything… you know we’re right. You’ve got to step up… stop letting Ryfel take all the glory. 



You’re a Luthren—we don’t lose… you just need to fight harder, like we taught you… remember how we trained you? You’ve got to be the best…”



Ham’s taunting tone echoed in Dain’s ears, his heavy hand still on Dain’s shoulder, the pressure making Dain’s knees buckle slightly. 



Dain’s breath hitched, his body freezing up as memories flooded back—Lards pinning him to the ground during “training,” Ham’s fists striking him when he couldn’t keep up, the constant shouts of “be stronger, be better.” 



His vision blurred, his hands clutching his arms tightly, his nails digging into his skin as he tried to ground himself, his body trembling.



Dain (shaky):

“I… I tried… I tried so hard… I…”



Lards (stern):

“Ham’s right… you’ve got the blood of a Luthren, Dain… we don’t lose to Redimirs. 



I didn’t raise you to come in second. Next time, you beat him… you hear me? You’ve got to be stronger, tougher… you can’t let him overshadow you like that…”



Lards’ voice grew sterner, his hands on his hips as he leaned forward, his gray eyes boring into Dain.



The weight of his father’s expectations pressed down on Dain, each word a reminder of the years of abuse he’d endured under the guise of “training.” Lards, Ham, and sometimes Tarby had beaten him during sparring sessions, claiming it would make him stronger, tougher—a true Luthren.



But the beatings had left Dain bruised and broken, his anger spilling over into his bullying of Kriscila, a way to lash out at the pain he felt at home.



Dain’s voice was barely a whisper, his words faltering as he froze, his eyes wide with panic, the festival’s warmth fading as the memories of abuse overwhelmed him.



Tarby, who had been silent, watched Dain intently, his quieter nature making him more attuned to his brother’s distress. He saw the way Dain clutched himself, his body shaking, his face pale, and his heart sank at the sight.



Tarby (urgent):

“Stop it, both of you! Look at him—look at Dain! You’re doing it again… you’re breaking him… can’t you see that?”



Tarby’s voice cut through the air, sharp and urgent, as he stepped between Dain and the others, his hands raised to halt their words.



His noble tunic was slightly rumpled, his face flushed with anger and guilt as he turned to Lards and Ham, his quiet demeanor replaced by a fierce protectiveness.



Tarby (angry):

“You’re delusional, both of you… talking about beating Ryfel, making Dain the leader… we already agreed before we came here—we know we can’t beat the Redimir family!



They’ve always been stronger… Pa, you fought with Ryker, you know that better than anyone! We came to congratulate Dain… to tell him we’re proud of him… not to tear him down again!”



Lards (defensive):

“Tarby, we’re just trying to push him to be better… he’s a Luthren, he—”



Tarby (furious):

“No, Pa! You’re not pushing him—you’re hurting him!



 Look at him… he’s shaking… he’s terrified… just like he was when we ‘trained’ him… when we beat him to make him ‘stronger’…



We abused him, Pa… we abused him, and we’re doing it again right now…”



Tarby’s voice broke, his hands trembling as he gestured to Dain, who was still frozen, clutching himself tightly, his breath coming in short, ragged gasps. Tarby reached out to hold Dain.



Lards’ face fell, his stern expression crumbling as he looked at Dain, the reality of Tarby’s words hitting him like a blow.



Tarby:

“I know its so late to say this Dain, no, my little brother. But I realized I was so wrong in going along with whatever it was to hurt you. We were so wrong.”



Ham:

“We… we didn’t mean… I… I thought we were helping him… I thought…”



Ham’s voice faltered, his heavy frame slumping as he stepped back, his hand falling from Dain’s shoulder, his round face pale with shock.



He looked at Dain, seeing the fear in his brother’s eyes, and the weight of their past actions crashed down on him.



Tarby (pleading):

“Dain… Dain, I’m sorry… we’re actually here to tell you we’re proud of you… you fought so well out there… better than any of us could’ve… we didn’t come to criticize you… I’m sorry… I should’ve stopped them sooner…”



Tarby’s voice softened, his eyes glistening with tears as he reached out, gently placing a hand on Dain’s arm, his touch light and careful. Dain flinched at first, but Tarby’s gentle tone broke through his panic, his trembling slowing as he looked at his brother.



Dain (shaky):

“You… you’re proud of me…? 



I… I thought… I thought I’d never be good enough… all those times you… you beat me… I thought I had to be better… I…”



Lards (regretful):

“Dain… I… I’m so sorry… 



I thought I was making you strong… like I had to be when I fought with Ryker… but I was wrong… I hurt you… we hurt you… And you’re more than good enough… you’re incredible, son…”



Lards’ voice cracked, his hands shaking as he stepped forward, pulling Dain into a careful hug, his gruff exterior shattered by guilt. Dain hesitated, then hugged him back, his tears falling as he clung to his father, the pain of their past starting to heal.



Ham (ashamed):

“I’m sorry, Dain… I… I didn’t realize… I thought I was helping you, pushing you… but I was wrong… 



You really did amazing out there… I’m proud of you, little brother…”



Ham’s voice was thick with shame, his heavy frame trembling as he joined the hug, his arms wrapping around Dain and Lards, his apology raw and heartfelt. He rested his forehead against Dain’s, his tears mixing with his brother’s.



Tarby:

“We’re all proud of you, Dain… we came to tell you that… we know we can’t beat the Redimirs… but you… You showed everyone what a Luthren can do… 



Your whole family wants to just be proud of you and it will take so much time to show you how much we mean it. 



We are sorry for everything… let’s start over… please…”



Tarby’s voice was soft, his tears falling as he added his arms to the group hug, the Luthren family united in their shared remorse and hope for a new beginning.



Dain (voice cracking):

"I… I can’t hold it in anymore… all those years…"



Tears streamed down his face, hot and unrelenting, carving trails through the dirt and bruises on his body. They didn’t erase the welts from the tournament or the faded marks of his family’s so-called training—those lingered, stubborn and cruel.



But these tears dug deeper, pulling at the scars no one could see, the ones etched into his soul from every shouted demand, every fist that landed when he wasn’t fast enough, strong enough.



His chest heaved, a sob breaking free as he clutched his arms tighter, as if he could hold himself together when everything inside was unraveling.



Dain (choking out):

"I tried… I tried so hard for you… Pa, Ham, Tarby… every hit, every time you said I wasn’t enough… I thought it’d make me better…"



His voice broke, raw and trembling, as memories flooded him—Lards pinning him to the dirt, Ham’s laughter as he crumpled, Tarby’s silent stares that stung worse than blows. 



The tears fell faster now, dripping onto the dirt, each one a quiet scream of the boy who’d fought to prove himself, only to feel smaller with every swing.



He sank to his knees, the festival’s warmth a distant blur, his shoulders shaking as he whispered to the ground. 



Dain:

"I just wanted you to see me… really see me… not some failure…" 



His words dissolved into a shuddering breath, the weight of a lifetime’s pain crashing down, leaving him bare and broken under the firelight.



Tarby (soft, tearful):

"Dain… oh, Dain, we see you now… we’re so sorry…"



Tarby dropped beside him, his own eyes glistening as he pulled Dain into his arms, heedless of the crowd.



Lards followed, his gruff voice cracking as he knelt, wrapping his weathered hands around his sons.



Lards:

"My boy… I was wrong… you’re stronger than I ever was…" 



Ham joined, his heavy frame trembling as he pressed his forehead to Dain’s, muttering, 



Ham:

"We’re proud, little brother… so damn proud… we’ll make it right…" 



Their arms tightened around him, a clumsy, tear-soaked huddle, and Dain let out a ragged sob—grief and relief tangling together. 



The family clung to each other, their apologies weaving a fragile promise under the festival lanterns, a new start born from the ashes of their past, warm and whole at last.



The Path Forgone

Tarby (smiling through tears):

"We’ve got a lot to make up for, Dain… let’s start tonight, huh? Grab some ale, sit by the fire…"



Dain (wiping his face):

"Yeah… yeah, I’d like that… all of us together…"



The Luthren family lingered in their embrace, the festival’s music swelling around them—lutes strumming, drums thumping, laughter rising like smoke.



A child darted past, ribbon trailing, her giggles cutting through the air. Dain glanced up, catching the flicker of lanterns against the cobblestones, the warmth of the bonfire painting his brothers’ faces softer than he’d ever seen them. For once, the weight on his chest felt lighter.



Ham (gruff but gentle):

"Come on, little brother… let’s find a spot before Milal eats all the damn skewers…"



A faint rumble rolled through the ground, barely noticeable under the crowd’s chatter. Dain frowned, tilting his head. The music faltered for a split second—lutes missing a note, a drummer pausing mid-beat. Tarby’s brow furrowed, his hand still on Dain’s shoulder.



Tarby (quiet):

"Did you feel that? Like… the earth shifted?"



Lards (squinting toward the gates):

"Probably just some drunk fool knocking over a cart… happens every festival…"



But the air thickened, a distant shout piercing the revelry—sharp, panicked, swallowed fast by the crowd’s hum. Dain stepped forward, eyes scanning the horizon where the gates loomed, too far to see clearly. Then—



A deafening roar split the night.



BOOM.



The gates erupted in a fireball, orange and fierce, hurling stone and screams into the sky. The festival froze, mugs clattering to the ground, dancers stumbling mid-step.



Ryfel (eyes wide open from unsettling nostalgia):

"I heard of this kind of explosion before! That’s not the festival, that’s an attack!"



He stood near the courts, the bonfire’s heat still licking at his back, his father Ryker beside him hefting a skewer and ale.



Ryker (low):

"Gates are too far for us to feel that here… somethin’s hit ‘em hard…"



Milal (edging closer):

"Master Ryker, should we—should we check on Lady Elda and Kriscila?"



The maid’s voice trembled, her apron clutched tight, but Ryfel comforted her with a pat, but his gaze locked on the fire’s glow. He exhaled, a flicker of relief for the safety of his Mother and Kris, steadying him.



Ryfel (firm):

"They’re fine, Milal—house is close but not that close. This is somethin’ else…"



A knot of festival-goers shuffled past, their boots kicking up dust as they drifted toward the gates—smiths with soot-stained hands, a wiry fighter still clutching a ribbon. Whispers snaked through the air, curling around the Redimirs like smoke.



Festival-Goer 2 (discussing nearby):

"Blacksmith District tried crashin’ the party late… got ambushed out there…but why? We ain’t stopping them."



Festival-Goer 3 (gossiping):

"I heard they got ambushed by a bunch of mages, magic and equipment stronger than anything they’ve got…"



Ryker:

"Stronger magic and weapons than the smiths? That’s no small feat… who would be able to do that?"



Ryfel (puzzled):

"The Inner Courts? But they don’t care much about us to even come here…"



[THOOM, THOOM, THOOM]



The crowd from around the Redimir estate to the walls jerked their heads back, eyes wide, facing the towering wall of the Outer Courts.



[THOOM, THOOM, THOOM]



[THOOM, THOOM, THOOM]



Small cracks spiderwebbed from the wall’s base, snaking upward—jagged, ugly gashes visible to every soul in the throng. The bonfires dimmed, the air trembling with each thud.



[THOOM, THOOM, THOOM]



Ryker (stunned):

"Ho-How? I’ve never seen cracks on our wall before!"



Festival-Goer 4 (choking):



"What the fuc—"



A thunderous crack split the night before anyone could finish.





[KRA-BOOM!]



The outer wall near the Redimir estate didn’t just shatter—it exploded. Stone shards flew like shrapnel, shredding a festival goer’s face mid-laugh, his body collapsing in a wet heap. Fire erupted, a roaring maw of orange and black, swallowing the dust as it choked the sky. 



Through the gaping hole thundered Knights, mounted on massive warhorses—beasts snorting steam, hooves pounding like war drums.



Their armor gleamed like molten shadow, both from the explosion and the violet fire crackling around their blades, riders and steeds a relentless tide of death.



Knight Commander (booming):

"Kill as many as you can! Take the young who are skillful with magic!"



The festival didn’t shatter—it ruptured. A knight spurred forward, his horse trampling a dancer—her scream cut off as hooves crushed her chest, blood pooling beneath. 



Another swung his blade from horseback, slashing a noble’s throat—red sprayed, his body slumping as his mug rolled through the dirt.



The knights charged, their violet flames scorching the air, cutting down dozens—bodies fell, trampled or sliced, the ground slick with blood and panic.



A mother shrieked, clutching her infant, only for a spear to punch through both—their bodies pinned to the ground, twitching, red pooling beneath.



Ryfel (horrified):

"No—no, this ain’t real—"



The knights surged, relentless, their violet flames searing flesh as they hacked through the crowd.



A smith’s arm flew, severed at the shoulder, his hammer clanging uselessly as he gargled blood.



Dozens fell in seconds—hundreds—limbs scattered, skulls crushed, the cobblestones slick with gore.



The air reeked of ash and fear, screams swallowing the peoples’ last gasps. A mother clutched her child, fleeing— they were too slow, as a knight’s spear knocked them sprawling, their cries fading into the chaos.



Ryker snarled, stepping forward, earth magic flaring in his fists.



Ryker (roaring):

"You fucking Bastards!"



He slammed both hands down—jagged stone pillars erupted from the earth, spearing a horse’s flank. The beast shrieked, rearing, its rider tumbling—Ryker charged, smashing the knight’s helm with an earth hardened fist, blood leaking from the cracks. Saving the family, as they escaped to safety.



Ryfel darted in, ducking a lance, grabbing a fallen weapon—he stabbed a horse’s leg, toppling its rider into another, both into the dirt.



Ryfel (grunting):

"Father—hit the ground again! End them!"



Ryker nodded, slamming the earth once more—spikes burst up, skewering the two riders, guts and organs spewing from the armor, killing them.



Milal rips off her maid’s apron and dress, revealing sleek, dark armor—tight leather and matte steel plates hugging her frame, mouth covered by a dark mask, shadow-streaked with subtle green accents similar to her hair, a ninja-like garb built for speed and silence.



Milal (sharp):

"Masters, please let me handle this! I need to protect you!"



She flicked her wrists—needles gleamed between her fingers, plucked from her belt, mixed with skewers she’d swiped from the feast. 



She hurled one, striking a knight’s neck—blood trickled as he clutched it, swaying. Another she stabbed into a horse’s eye—the beast bucked, throwing its rider into a bonfire, flames swallowing his thrashing form.







Grandpa Ironfoot



The festival dissolved through the district as chaos ensued with hooves thundering, steel clashing, and wails rose over the crackling violet fire, the Redimirs however, carving a defiant stand amid the slaughter.



Near another bonfire’s edge, Grandpa Ironfoot and Bram squared off, their limbs planted in the blood-soaked dirt, Solidifying earth into their hardened bulky fighting style.



Grandpa Ironfoot (bellowing):

"Ya ass gaped, horse-fucking faggot pieces of shits picked the wrong night—let’s bury ‘em, Bram!"



Bram (shocked):

"What the fuck grandpa?! I’ve never- Hahaha whatever, lets go!"



Ironfoot clenched his fists in the ground—earth magic surged, dirt and stone swirling up his arms, hardening into jagged, rock-clad gauntlets.



Bram grinned, mirroring him—mud coiled around his legs, solidifying into thick, earthen greaves. 



A knight spurred his horse forward, lance gleaming violet—Grandpa swung, his stone fist smashing the shaft to splinters, then slammed into the horse’s chest. Bone cracked, the beast collapsing, pinning its rider beneath.



Bram (whooping):

"One down—keep ‘em comin’!"



Bram leapt, his earthen leg crashing down on the fallen knight’s helm—metal buckled, blood oozing as the man twitched and stilled.



Another knight charged, slashing at Grandpa—the blade sparked off his rock arm, leaving a shallow gash, red trickling through the cracks.



He laughed, unfazed, grabbing the horse’s reins and yanking—the rider flipped, crashing headfirst into the dirt.



Grandpa Ironfoot (growling):

"That all you got? Wait till I shove my fist right through your arse! If ya can take a horse, ya can take mine!"



Two knights galloped in, their swords blazing violet—Bram ducked one, his earthen leg absorbing a blow that chipped the stone but held. 



He spun, smashing his fist into a horse’s flank—ribs snapped, the beast toppling, its rider rolling free.



Grandpa charged the second, his rock fists pounding the knight’s chest—armor dented, blood sprayed from the man’s mouth as he fell, lifeless. Five down, the ground littered with their ruin.



The knights adapted, their horses weaving tighter, speeding up—three more surged in, blades slashing in a blur.



Bram (panting):

"They’re fast—too damn fast… Ugh my body can’t fight like this twice a day."



Grandpa swung, too slow—steel grazed his shoulder, slicing flesh but bouncing off his earthen arm.



Bram kicked out, his stone leg shattering a horse’s knee—the rider tumbled, skewered by his own purple fiery lance as he hit the ground.



Six now, maybe seven, but the knights’ numbers swelled, their violet fire flaring brighter.



Grandpa Ironfoot (grunting):

"Keep up, Bram—Show these fuckers an Ironfoot up their ass."



A knight’s mace smashed Bram’s earthen limbs—cracks spidered up the stone, blood seeping from his shin, but he roared, slamming both fists into the horse’s side.



The beast staggered, crushing its rider against a cart—eight down. Grandpa took a slash across his chest—cloth tore, red welled, yet his rock arms held, smashing another knight’s helm clean off—blood and teeth flew, nine fallen.



Bram (gasping):

"Grandpa—they’re circlin’ us!"



The knights tightened ranks understanding how formidable their opponents are, ten riders breaking off, their horses snorting as they wheeled around—eyes locked on Bram, his breaths ragged, his earthen legs trembling from the tournament’s toll. 



A lance thrust at him—he stumbled, too slow, the tip grazing his side—blood streaked, his groan cut short as Grandpa roared, shoving him back.



Grandpa Ironfoot (snarling):

"Not my boy, you child-loving faggots—come at me instead!"



He stomped, earth surging—stone thickened around his arms, swelling into a jagged shield, dirt coiling up to encase Bram behind a wall of rock.



Three knights charged Bram—their blades sparked off Grandpa’s earthen barrier, violet fire scorching the stone.



He swung, smashing a horse’s skull—its rider slumped, ten down—but more galloped in, five now, then seven, their lances and swords slashing in waves.



Bram (yelling):

"Grandpa—let me fight, damn it!"



A blade pierced Grandpa’s shoulder—blood sprayed, but he growled, earth thickening around him, blocking a lance aimed at Bram.



Another slashed his side—red poured, soaking his tunic, yet he piled more stone between them, his arms shaking.



The knights sped up, eight riders circling tight—lances stabbed, swords hacked—three sank into his chest, blood gushing as he staggered, still piling earth to shield Bram.



Grandpa Ironfoot (gasping):

"St-Stay… back, Bramson… I got this…"



Four more knights joined—blades plunged, one through his gut, another his ribs—red pooled beneath, his rock shield cracking as he sank to one knee. Bram pounded the stone wall, his fists bloody, voice breaking. 



Grandpa Ironfoot (in his final breath):

"At least this time… I died before my grandson… Run Bram, be safe, I lov-"



A final lance drove through Grandpa’s heart—he choked, blood bubbling at his lips, his earthen arms crumbling as he slumped forward, the barrier falling away.



Bram (screaming):

"No—no, NO! YOU FUCKERS! You goddamn horse-fucking faggot bastards—I’ll rip your fuckin’ throats out!"



His rage boiled, vulgarities tearing from him mimicking his grandpa, fists slamming the dirt as the knights were wheeled back by the force, Grandpa’s blood drenching a rage-fueled Bram in despair.



Fury erupted—Bram slammed his fists into his earthen greaves, stone shattering, chunks dropping to the gore-streaked dirt. He ripped off his earthen limbs, flinging them aside—his own limbs gleamed, muscle sculpted tight. 



No armor, no weight—just raw speed and rage.



Bram (roaring):

"You cock-suckin’ fucks—I’ll tear your gayass heads off!"



He shot forward—a blur of motion, his bare fists slicing the air like thunder. A knight spurred his horse, lance aimed—Bram dodged, a streak of speed, grabbing the shaft mid-thrust.



He yanked—the rider flipped, crashing skull-first into the ground, blood pooling under a cracked helm. Bram spun the lance, hurling it through the horse’s flank and into the fallen rider—the beast shrieked, collapsing in a spray of red.



Bram (snarling):

"That’s for Grandpa, you cock-eating bastard!"



Two knights charged—Bram blurred again, ducking a violet sword, leaping onto the first horse’s back. 



He seized the rider’s neck—twisted hard—bone snapped, the man slumping as Bram kicked him into the dirt.



The second swung—Bram dropped, rolling under the horse, slamming his fist up into its belly—ribs cracked, the beast stumbling, crushing its rider beneath. Three down, his speed a storm of vengeance.



Bram (yelling):

"Come on, you faggot fucks! I’ll shove your own swords so far up your asses you’ll taste ‘em!"



A fourth knight galloped in—Bram darted aside, his reflexes razor-sharp, grabbing the rider’s arm mid-slash. He pulled—the knight flew from the saddle, slamming into a cart—wood splintered, blood streaking as he lay still.



Bram spun, facing the circling knights, his chest heaving, fists dripping with blood, sweat and rage, Grandpa’s body at his feet.



Bram (screaming):

"Who’s next, you dickless cunts? I’ll rip your fuckin’ dicks out and feed ‘em to your horses!"

The knights hesitated, their violet fire flickering as Bram stood, a whirlwind of fury, ready to tear through them all. Fourteen—no, fifteen—of their own lay scattered—horses broken, riders sprawled in blood-soaked heaps, helms cracked and limbs twisted.

A shadow loomed—a hulking figure astride a warhorse twice the size of the others, its hide black as pitch, steam curling from its nostrils. 



The Magic Knight Commander dismounted, his armor pulsing with violet runes, a longsword in hand that hummed with power, its edge glowing brighter than the rest. 



His helm tilted, eyes glinting through the slits, fixed on Bram.



Knight Commander (voice deep, amused):

"Fifteen of my men… torn apart by an old man and a single whelp. You’ve got fire, boy—I like that."



Bram spat, blood and spit hitting the dirt, his muscles flexing as he squared up, fists clenched.



Bram (snarling):

"Fuck your liking, you bastard—I’ll shove that sword down your throat ‘til it comes out your ass!"



The commander laughed—a low, guttural sound—and raised his blade. Violet fire flared, coiling up his arm, the air crackling as the ground beneath him shuddered.



He swung—a shockwave ripped forward, faster than Bram could blink. Bram dove, the blast shearing past, slicing a cart clean in two—wood splintered, a scream cut off as a bystander split in half, burning alive that was hidden behind the cart.



Bram:

"Fuck, I couldn’t save that guy too—Bu-but that’s no normal magic…"



The commander suddenly charged—his speed matched Bram’s even wearing his heavy armor, and his power dwarfed Bram’s. 



A slash came—a shocked Bram narrowly dodged, a blur, but the blade’s fire grazed his arm—skin split, red welling as he hissed. 



He swung back, fist arcing—the commander blocked with his gauntlet, violet sparks flying, and Bram staggered, his knuckles stinging.



Knight Commander (grinning):

"Strong… but raw. You’re no match, boy—not yet."



Bram roared, darting in—his fist slammed the commander’s chest, muscle meeting steel. 



The armor dented, but the commander didn’t flinch—his free hand shot out, wind surging, blasting Bram back.



He hit the ground hard, rolling, blood dripping from a split lip as he scrambled up.



Bram (panting):

"Fuck you—I ain’t done!"



The commander tilted his head, intrigued, then raised his sword high. 



The violet glow pulsed, a signal—and the circling knights snapped to attention, their horses snorting, weapons ready.



Knight Commander (booming):

"Enough play. Capture him—alive! This one’s mine to break."



The knights surged—ten, twelve, more—lances leveled, swords drawn, closing in like a noose. Bram spun, dodging a thrust, smashing a rider’s knee—bone cracked, the man toppling—but another lance grazed his shoulder, blood streaking.



He snarled, fists flying, but the commander stepped forward, mana flaring—another shockwave hit, knocking Bram to his knees, breath ragged.



Bram (growling):

"You fuckin’ coward—face me yourself!"

Ropes lashed out, knights swarming; Bram thrashed, roaring curses, but the violet glow bound him tight, dragging him into the dark as the commander watched, satisfied.



Dain’s Family

The Farmland District was smoldering—violet fire danced along the edges, the thunder of hooves shook the ground, and the Magic Knights carved a bloody swath through the district’s heart.



Bram’s furious roars had faded into the night, swallowed by his capture, leaving the festival a shattered husk. 



Near another bonfire’s flickering remnants, Dain stood with his family—Lards, Ham, and Tarby—still raw from their tear-soaked huddle, their newfound bond a fragile light in the dark.



Dain (voice tight):

"Stay together—we’re gettin’ outta this…"



A knight burst through the haze—his warhorse snorted, lance gleaming violet as it streaked toward Tarby’s back.



Lards bellowed, swinging a broken plank—the wood cracked against the horse’s flank, the beast snorting, but the rider thrust, grazing Lards’ arm—blood bloomed through his sleeve. 



Ham roared, charging with a skewer—he jabbed at the knight’s leg, drawing a grunt, but the rider wheeled, sword slashing down. Ham ducked, the blade whistling past.



Tarby (shouting):

"Dain—there’s more comin’!"



Two knights thundered in—hooves pounded, their violet flames casting a deathly glow. One swung at Lards—Dain lunged, shoving his father aside—the sword bit his shoulder, red spilling, but he stood firm, shouting over the chaos.



Dain (yelling):

"Run—damn it, all of you, run now!"



Lards hesitated, swinging his plank again—it splintered against a knight’s helm, the rider swaying.



Ham tackled the second horse’s legs—the beast stumbled, but the knight slashed, cutting Ham’s arm—blood streaked as he cursed. Tarby grabbed a fallen mug, hurling it—it clanged off a knight’s chest, useless but defiant.



Ham (growling):

"We ain’t leavin’ you, little brother!"



Dain (snapping):

"Stop being an idiot! Go—I’ll catch up! Move!"



A knight spurred forward—Dain dodged the lance, grabbing the rider’s arm—he yanked, earth magic flaring in his fists. Stone surged up his hands, hardening, and he smashed the knight’s chest—armor crumpled, blood sprayed from the man’s mouth as he toppled, horse crashing beside him. One down.



Dain (panting):

"See? I got this—run, I’ll be right behind you!"



Lards nodded, gruff and reluctant, pulling Tarby and Ham back—they stumbled toward the courts’ edge, dodging fallen bodies and violet flames.



Tarby glanced over his shoulder—Dain stood alone, three knights circling, their horses snorting, lances gleaming.



A blade slashed—Dain ducked, blood dripping from his shoulder, and stomped the ground—earth spiked up, jagged and rough, tripping a horse.



The rider fell, rolling, but another thrust—Dain took it in the side, red gushing, yet he roared, piling stone between the knights and his fleeing family.



Tarby (whispering):

"Dain… come on…"



The knights pressed—four now, blades flashing. Dain swung his rock-clad fist—another horse stumbled, crashing into the dirt, but a lance pierced his gut—blood poured, his breath hitching.



He growled, earth surging again—stone walls rose, crumbling fast, slowing the riders as Lards, Ham, and Tarby reached the shadows. A mace swung—Dain’s arm took the blow, bone cracking, red streaking—yet he shoved forward, shouting through the pain.



Dain (gasping):

"Keep goin’—don’t stop!"



Lards gripped Tarby’s arm, dragging him deeper into the courts’ edge—Ham stumbled beside them, blood dripping from his own cuts, their figures shrinking into the smoky dark. 



The knights wheeled, five now, their violet fire flaring brighter. 



A sword slashed—Dain twisted, the blade carving his chest—cloth ripped, blood welled, soaking his tunic. 



He stomped, earth trembling—jagged spikes shot up, tripping another horse, its rider tumbling—but a lance grazed his thigh, more red spilling as he staggered.



Dain (grunting):

"Run—get away—please…"



His voice echoed, lost in the chaos—his family too far to hear, weaving through the festival’s ruins, safe beyond the bonfire’s reach.



The knights tightened their circle—six riders, hooves pounding. A mace crashed down—Dain raised his rock-clad arm, the blow shattering stone, fracturing bone beneath—blood sprayed, his arm hanging limp. 



Dain (rasping):

"Run… keep runnin’… don’t look back…"



The air thickened with ash and screams—Lards, Ham, and Tarby already vanished into the night, long gone and safe but oblivious to Dain’s fading fight.



The knights pressed in—seven now, their violet mana crackling. A sword slashed his back—he stumbled forward, red streaking the dirt, voice hoarse but unbroken.



Dain (whispering):

"Run… Keep running please…"



No one heard—his family long gone, racing toward the district’s edge, alive because of him. 



The knights loomed—eight riders, their shadows swallowing the flickering light.



A mace smashed his ribs—bones snapped, blood flecked his lips as he fell to his knees. He clawed the ground, earth trembling faintly—stone rose, weak and crumbling, a final shield for a family he couldn’t see.



A lance pierced his chest—red sprayed, his body swaying—but his lips moved, a faint plea escaping.



Dain (barely audible):

"Be safe… please… I’m here. I’m just glad yall are saf-"



The knights struck as one—blades plunged, one through his gut, another his heart—blood pooled beneath, his rock-clad hands twitching, crumbling to dust. His head slumped, eyes dimming, a soft smile curving his lips—his last breath a wish for the family he’d saved. 



His final words carried away on the wind as the knights turned, leaving his broken form in the bloodied-stained dark.





Lux Solmere

Right before the breach,the festival’s heart still flickered near the courts—lanterns swayed, lutes strummed faintly, the bonfire’s glow a frail shield against the night.

Aurex stood with Lux, his silver hair catching the light, his gold eyes crinkling as he spun her in a playful twirl—tournament exhaustion lingered, but her laugh kept him young.

Lux (giggling):

"Father, I can’t believe you still have strength to dance, especially when Ryfel smoked you today!"



Aurex (grinning):

"Oh, Luxy, I let him win—keeps the kid’s ego in check. Besides, I’ve still got moves…"



She stumbled into his arms, her gold eyes sparkling—father and daughter, a bright spot amid the revelry.



The crowd buzzed, mugs clinked, but a low rumble shook the ground—closer than the gate’s distant blast, heavier. Aurex’s smile faded, his hand tightening on Lux’s shoulder.



Aurex (low):

"That’s not right… stay close, Bright Star…"



A thunderous crack split the night.



[KRA-BOOM!]



The outer wall near the Redimir estate—stones etched with childhood memories—exploded inward, fire roaring up, dust choking the air. Through the breach charged Magic Knights—150 strong, their horses snorting, armor shimmering like shadow, violet fire crackling around their blades.



Knight Commander (booming, distant):

"Kill as many as you can! Take the young who are skillful with magic!"



The festival shattered—screams drowned the lutes, a dancer fell, blood pooling under a trampled ribbon. 



Aurex yanked Lux behind him, his bare fists clenching—no armor, no sword, just a father’s instinct. They dashed towards the woods.



Lux (shouting):

"Father—what’s happening?!"



Aurex (sharp):

"Behind me, Luxy—don’t move!"



A knight spurred forward—his lance gleamed, aimed at Lux.



Aurex roared, shoving her down—the tip grazed his arm, red streaking, but he grabbed the shaft, twisting—the rider lurched, horse rearing.



Aurex slammed his elbow into the knight’s helm—metal crumpled, blood leaked as the man slumped, horse bolting riderless.



Aurex (grunting):

"Not my girl—not today…"



Three knights charged—hooves thundered, violet swords humming. Aurex ducked a slash, his fists glowing faintly with light and fire he burnt through a horse’s leg. Bone seared and snapped, the beast toppling, rider pinned.



Lux scrambled up, reaching for him—another blade swung, Aurex took it on the shoulder—blood sprayed, his growl masking the pain.



Lux (desperate):

"Father—let me help!"



Aurex (snapping):

"No—stay down! I’ve got this!"



The knights circled—five now, their violet fire casting ghastly shadows.



Aurex’s eyes darted—his tournament gear was gone, but the pinned rider twitched, his armor glinting.



He lunged, ripping a dented pauldron free—metal screeched as he cracked it into shards, hurling them into the dirt around him.



Light flared from his fists, hitting the shards—mirrors gleamed, illusions blooming: three Aurexes flickered into being, each one snarling, fists raised.



Aurex (grinning):

"Let’s dance, you bastards…"



The knights hesitated—two swung at illusions, blades slicing air. Aurex darted low, snatching a fallen dagger from the pinned knight’s belt—silent, swift.



He spun behind a rider, stabbing up—blood spurted from the man’s side, the horse rearing as he slumped. One down.



The illusions flickered, holding their gaze—another knight charged a fake, and Aurex slipped in, driving the dagger into a horse’s flank—the beast collapsed, crushing its rider. 



Two gone.



Lux (whispering):

"Father… how…?"



Aurex (hushed):

"Stay quiet, Luxy—follow me…"



He grabbed her wrist, weaving through the chaos—six knights now, their violet fire flaring as they slashed at shadows.



Aurex snatched a broken lance tip from the dirt, pocketing it—his illusions wavered, but he pulled Lux toward the woods’ edge, a jagged opening in the undergrowth just beyond the courts.



He shoved her in—branches scratched, darkness swallowed her gold eyes.



Aurex (urgent):

"Hide—don’t move, Bright Star. Don't be too bright for now ok? I’ll lead ‘em off…"



Lux (pleading):

"No—don’t leave me!"



Aurex (soft):

"I’ll be back—promise."



He turned, fists glowing—more shards scattered, illusions multiplying: five Aurexes sprinted into the fray.



The knights roared, chasing—seven, eight riders now, their horses snorting.



Aurex darted, lance tip in hand—he leapt, stabbing a knight’s neck—blood sprayed, the man toppling as his horse bolted.



Three down.



Another swung—Aurex ducked, the blade grazing his arm—red streaked, but he rolled, hurling a mirror shard—it caught the violet fire, blinding a rider.



He stabbed the lance tip up—four gone, the knight choking on his own blood.



Aurex (panting):

"Keep comin’—I ain’t done…"



The knights regrouped—ten now, their violet flames surging.



They raised their swords—fire and light erupted, a blinding wave—illusions shattered, the mirrors cracking under the blaze.



Aurex cursed, sprinting back toward the woods—nine knights pursued, hooves pounding. He reached the opening, glancing in—Lux crouched, eyes wide, safe.



He spun—too late. The air shimmered, a ripple of heat and light bending the night—hundreds of knights loomed, their violet fire a sea of death stretching across the courts. 



Aurex froze, his breath catching—his own trick turned against him, an illusion of endless foes. 



Shadows multiplied, horses snorted in unison, their hooves a deafening drumbeat that shook the earth.



Each knight’s armor glinted, their blades pulsed with purple fire—rows upon rows, an army conjured from his own craft, mocking him in its perfection.



Aurex (muttering):

"No… no, this can’t be…"



The shimmer deepened—violet flames flared brighter, casting ghastly reflections off shattered festival lanterns. 



He squinted—details sharpened: the nearest knight’s helm bore a dent he’d made, mirrored a hundred times over. 



Another’s lance flickered, echoing the one he’d snapped minutes ago. His illusions had been simple—three, five fakes at most—but this… this was a flood, a tidal wave of his own making twisted beyond control.



Aurex (growling):

"You bastards… usin’ my own game…"



He stepped back—his fists flared, light and fire dancing faint across his knuckles, but the glow sputtered, weak from the day’s toll.



The knights advanced—hundreds of boots crunched, a synchronized wall of steel and flame. He hurled a spark—it struck a mirror-shard illusion, shattering it—glass dust puffed, but ten more knights flickered into its place, their violet eyes locked on him. 



His chest tightened—his mirrors were gone, smashed in the fight, his pockets empty of tricks.



Aurex (panting):

"Come on… think, damn it… I’ve beaten worse…"



The air pulsed—mana thickened, a hum that rattled his bones. He darted left—an illusion swung, the blade whistling—real or fake, he couldn’t tell.



He rolled, dirt smearing his bloodied tunic—another lance thrust, grazing his thigh—red trickled, but the knight dissolved as he struck back, fist passing through air.



A laugh echoed—low, guttural—hundreds of voices layered, taunting him from the sea of shadows.



Aurex (snarling):

"Show yourselves, you cowards—who’s pullin’ this?!"



The illusion shifted—knights parted, their ranks rippling like water. 



A lone figure emerged—not mirrored, not fake—his warhorse towered, black as midnight, violet runes pulsing across armor that drank the light.



The Knight Commander dismounted, his longsword humming, its edge a blazing arc of mana. The hundreds held—still, silent—an endless backdrop to his real threat.



Knight Commander (calm):

"Clever trick, old man—mirrors and shadows. Took me a moment to turn it back on you."



Aurex (spitting):

"You’re a cheap thief—takes more’n that to beat me!"



The Commander tilted his helm—hundreds of knights mirrored the move, a chorus of menace.



Aurex lunged—his fist flared, aiming for the real foe—the Commander sidestepped, impossibly fast, and the illusions surged—ten blades slashed at once.



Aurex twisted—two grazed his arm, blood streaking—eight faded, fakes, but the sting was real. He swung again—the Commander parried, violet sparks flying, the force knocking Aurex back three steps.



Aurex (gasping):

"Bastard… how many are you?!"



Knight Commander (amused):

"Just me… and your own mind. You’re second-best here, we were told—let’s test that."



The sea of knights roared—violet fire erupted, a blinding storm—Aurex shielded his eyes, light and heat searing his skin.



He stomped—earth trembled, a faint stone spike rose—but the illusions trampled it, hooves shattering rock. He threw a punch—light flared, hitting nothing—hundreds laughed, their voices a cacophony.



His shoulder throbbed, blood dripping—his magic flickered, too weak, his tricks spent.



Aurex (whispering):

"Luxy… I’m sorry… I can’t…"



He turned—sprinting for the woods, the opening where Lux hid.



The illusions parted—too easy—a trap. The air screamed—mana surged behind him—he glanced back—hundreds of knights vanished, leaving only the Commander, his longsword raised.



Aurex’s gold eyes widened—too late. The blade plunged through his back—blood gushed, his knees buckled, the world tilting as he fell forward, crashing toward the opening in the undergrowth.



His body hit the ground hard—silver hair fanning out, blood pooling beneath, but he twisted, dragging himself to cover the jagged hole.



Lux crouched inside—her gold eyes locked on his through the branches, tears streaming as she clapped both hands over her mouth, muffling a sob.



The Commander stepped closer, his boots crunching, his sword dripping red—violet runes pulsed along its edge, a smug tilt to his helm.



Knight Commander (scoffing):

"Huh… I thought this’d be harder. Intel said you were the second best here—This kingdom is too easy."



Aurex coughed—blood flecked his lips, his shoulder wound seeping—but he shifted, pressing his chest against the opening, hiding Lux completely. 



She trembled, her fingers digging into her face, tears spilling over as his gold eyes found hers—soft, warm, a faint smile curving through the pain.



A knight lunged—his blade sank into Aurex’s side—red poured, his body jerking, but he held firm, his smile unwavering.



Aurex (gasping):

"My Bright Star… you’re safe…"



Another knight struck—a lance pierced his chest—blood sprayed, his breath hitching, yet he leaned harder into the opening, shielding her with his bulk.



Lux’s eyes widened, her sob breaking free—silent, choked—as she pressed against the dirt, helpless.



The Commander raised his sword again—violet fire flared—and drove it through Aurex’s shoulder—red streaked down his arm, his fingers twitching, but his smile stayed, locked on the hidden space where Lux hid.



Knight Commander (musing):

"Pathetic… This wasn’t even a fight, especially… dying with your back faced against me."



A final knight stabbed—his blade plunged through Aurex’s spine, guts and blood gushed, spilling into the earth around the opening.



Aurex slumped—his body sagged, silver hair draping over the branches, but he held on, to be a wall between Lux and death.



The Commander yanked his sword free—red sprayed all over Lux’ face one last time—and turned, gesturing to his men.



Knight Commander (disgusted):

"Leave him—not even worth my time."



The knights rode away, their violet fire fading into the night—hooves thundered off, leaving silence and ruin.



Lux stared—her father’s gold eyes dimmed, his smile frozen as blood trickled from his lips, his body a mangled shield over her hiding spot. 



She bit her hand harder, tears flooding—her wail trapped, raw, as he lay still, guarding her to his last breath.



The Redimir Family

The field of the festival near the Redimir estate burned—violet fire clawed the walls, festival lanterns flickered in ruin, the bonfire’s embers a faint pulse in the night.



Ryfel, Ryker, and Milal stood amidst the chaos—twenty over knights already dead by their hands: horses skewered, riders crushed or bleeding out, violet flames snuffed in the dirt. 



Their family’s mission wasn’t just survival—every strike was aimed to save the fleeing crowd, nobles and farmers alike scrambling for safety.



Ryfel stomped, a spike piercing a knight’s chest—blood sprayed, the horse collapsing.



Ryker roared, stone fists smashed a helm—red leaked as the rider slumped.



Milal spun in the air, flinging needles, two knights toppling, throats pierced.



Ryfel (shouting):

"Keep ‘em moving, Father, we gotta get ‘em outta here!"



Ryker (gruff):

"No more pointless deaths under my Lordship. On Redimir fucking land. You are all dead!"



Ryker swung, stone fists smashing a knight’s head in, crushing his helm.



Milal darted—skewers flew, another knight toppling, eyes punctured.



Twenty-five down.



The enemy had to allocate more, with six more knights charging in, violet swords humming, trampling a fallen banner. Ryfel yanked a man from a horse’s path blowing him away with wind, then tripping a rider by shooting an earth pillar into the horse’s chest. 



Milal (sharp):

"They’re targeting the young—save who you can!"



Another seven more knights came forward.



Ryker slammed the ground, stone walls rising, a Farmland girl slipped through the gap, screaming for her mother, reaching for safety. 



However, a lance grazed Ryker’s arm, knocking him down from the force. Eight more knights started circling, violet fire flaring. 



Ryker (firm):

"There’s too many, we need more firepower! Go get your gear, son— the workshop, now! We’ll hold ‘em!"



Ryfel nodded. Minutes to the estate workshop stretched ahead. 



Ryker’s roars echoed behind him. Milal’s whirring in the air with steel chakrams faded in the night, slashing into the throats of the Knights. 



Screams dwindled as Ryfel crashed through the workshop door. Shelves lay toppled. His utility belt hung on a peg, bombs, and grappling hooks in view. He strapped it on, as well as his revolver gauntlets that were cracked from the battle with Aurex. He tested it, the gauntlets sparked and misfired weakly.



Ryfel (annoyed):

"Fuck… Shit this has gotta be enough for them…"



He raced back. Three minutes burned away. The estate faded behind through the haze. 



As Ryfel arrived, the scene before him made his blood curl. 



A low laugh cut the air—cold and guttural—the Knight Commander’s voice. 



Ryfel skidded to a halt. Violet fire bathed the scene. Ryker was battling the Commander in a storm of stone and steel. His fists glowed with earth magic, smashing at the Commander’s longsword with relentless fury.



Ryker (roaring):

"You have desecrated my home, you bastards, get out of our kingdom!!"



Ryker jumped high and swung again, stone met steel with a deafening clang, but the sword deflected and slashed through the air, impossibly fast.



In the silhouette of the night, surrounded by purple flames, Ryfel’s heart sank deep, as he witnessed his Father’s leg dismembered at the thigh. Blood gushed in a torrent as the limb fell to the dirt with a wet thud.



Ryker (crying):

"AHHHH! Ahahhhhhh, rughhh."



Ryker cried in a sound of rage and pain tearing from his chest. He swung a defiant stone fist even as he crumpled, his remaining leg buckling under him as he slowly fainted.



Ryker (gasping):

"Not… done… you son of a—"



Knight Commander (laughing):

"Hahaha what is this? He was supposed to be the best? This Ry guy? Who the fuck gave you all this crappy rumor?”



Ryfel’s heart seized. His father’s blood pooled, staining the ground red.



Above, Milal lay sprawled and unconscious on a broken roof. Tiles cracked beneath her still form.



Blood streaked her face, a dark line trailing from her temple where she’d been struck. The Magic Knights gathered below—now more than thirty of them, their violet-armored shadows swallowing the light, hooves snorting as they watched the Commander toy with Ryker.



Rage consumed him. Ryfel’s hands flew to his utility belt.



Every gadget was primed, his mana surging within. He yanked the hook launcher and fired. 



Steel cables whipped out and snared the legs of three horses. With a hard pull, the horses tangled and crashed to the ground.



Their riders were pinned beneath, limbs snapped at the bone, blood oozing from their armor.



Ryfel stomped the earth. Jagged stone spikes shot up and pierced two knights through their ribs. Blood sprayed as they fell lifeless.



Ryfel (snarling):

"Choke on your own blood you fucks!"

Channeling wind to inflate his armor. Ryfel launched into the sky, leaving a swirl of dust below. In his mind, he urged himself, Higher. Hit them fast.

He dropped a frag grenade. It exploded on impact, and shrapnel tore through three knights.

Blood misted the air as horses screamed in panic. He hurled a flashbang next. Blinding light flared across the battlefield. Four knights clutched their eyes and reeled in confusion. 

Ryfel:
"Blind them, burn them." 

Smoke grenades burst below, clouding the air in gray. Incendiary grenades followed. Flames roared to life, and two riders caught fire. Their limbs charred as they fell shrieking to the ground. Ten knights were down.

Ryfel (thinking):

“Not fast enough shit. Dad’s still bleeding, I gotta use it all, now!”



His mana circled faster, as he dove down towards the knights on the ground.



Earth and water melded in his hands. He swung his arms, and mud blades slashed outward. One knight’s throat opened, blood gushing as he collapsed. 



Another, he landed on the horse in front of the knight, Ryfel thrust his palm forward. Air blasted out in a shriek and forced its way into another knight’s mouth. The knight’s helm cracked, his brain bursting under the pressure. 



Red leaked from the seams as he fell—twelve gone. Light flared in Ryfel’s fist. 



Blinding beams shot out and fried their retinas, as they clutched their eyes.



Fire followed instantly, cauterizing their face in a hiss of flame. The knight toppled, thirteen dead. 



Ryfel (yelling):

"Die! Fucking die!"



He jumped and spun mid-air and fired the hooks again. Two more horses, stabbed in the eyes, tripped and fell. Their riders were crushed beneath stone spikes that stabbed up from the ground raised by Ryfel. 



It wasn’t just a bloodbath, it was a full river as it marked fifteen knights down. Ryfel hovered, his chest heaving, blood dripping from a grazed arm.



The Commander stepped forward. His longsword glowed with violet mana crackling along its edge. His armor pulsed, and he leapt into the air to meet Ryfel.



Knight Commander (excited):

"It looks like my intel wasn’t wrong after all! Let’s dance in the sky."



Ryfel (roaring):

"YOU! You are going to pay!"



Ryfel rocketed forward, air jets hissing in his armor. He fired hooks—cables snagged the Commander’s legs mid-leap. Ryfel yanked, pulling him off-balance.



Earth surged in his hands, stone spikes arced through the air, but the Commander slashed, violet shockwaves blasting them apart.



Ryfel spun and dodged, while hurling a smoke grenade. Gray clouded the Commander’s vision.



Ryfel (thinking):

Blind him—hit hard!



He fired a flashbang, blinding light searing the air. The Commander grunted, shielding his eyes. 



Ryfel swung with water blasting onto the armor, seeping into the gaps, he froze the water immediately, cutting and pricking the Commander’s chest. Blood trickled through his armor. 



Ryfel (screaming):

"You’re mine, you fuck!"



The Commander swung his longsword, another shockwave with violet fire flared, but Ryfel jetted upward, dodging. 



He tossed a frag grenade, reaching right to the Commander’s belt. It exploded mid-air, force and shrapnel cracking the Commander’s armor from the front—the force slamming him to the ground, denting its back.



Ryfel dove, completely not letting up, he used light beams to blind again—hooks fired, snagging the Commander’s left arm. He pulled tight, increasing his speed to the collapsed Commander.



Ryfel (yelling):

"An eye for an eye, you trash!"



Water melded with hardened thin earth, a full blade of high pressure stone slashed down, severing the Commander’s left arm halfway at the shoulder. Blood gushed from the limb.



Ryfel blasted himself down with a final bolt from the air.



He stamps both feet right onto the mangling arm at sonic speeds, cracking through the arm, shattering the shouldering, and ultimately dismembering the Commander.



Knight Commander (panicking):

"AHHHHHHHH, ahhhh, MY ARM! MY FUCKING ARM! Gahhhh he-help me!”



The shocked knights around the battle were dismayed but they leapt into clumsy action.



Ten threw out chains whipping through the air. 



Ryfel spun and air blasted, knocking two back but a bumbled chain snagged his leg. He threw out a frag grenade, blasting another knight down but more chains lashed his arms, his waist. Even as he thrashed around, gadgets spent, muscles torn, and spirit fleeting. The remaining knights could barely hold him down.



Ryfel (screaming):

"Get off me!"



The dismayed knights were easily flung around by Ryfel’s rage through his magic. Seeing this, the Knight Commander got up, his dominant hand clutching the hole where his left arm once hung, blood seeping through his fingers as he pressed to staunch the flow.



He stumbled forward frantically, his breaths ragged, a flustered mind consumed with revenge. Making his way to a fainted Ryker.



Knight Commander (breathing heavily):

"Move any further, and I will end this man’s life!”



Ryfel stops, his eyes drawn towards his father being held hostage.



Ryfel (rages):

"YOU COWARD! Running away and taking my father hostage? How miserable of a loser can you be?"



Knight Commander (laughing):

"Aaahahahaha! This is your father? Goooood. Men capture him now! Fight back and I will cut him in two!”



Ryfel slumped, resigning to his fate. The knights started chaining him up, but his eyes burnt intensely towards his father’s safety.



Ryfel (biting his lip):

"Mark my words, I will be the one to end you. Limb by limb, eye by eye. 



Resorting to use my family against me, I will destroy just like I have did today."



Knight Commander (frantic):

"Yo-you got lucky, you stupid kid! I didn’t lose!!! Get me my sword! I will end this pathetic fool.”



Ryfel:

"Pathetic? You lost, you worthless trash. Look at what’s missing, a piece of shit that doesn’t even have an arm anymore."



Knight Commander (vein bursting):

"FU-FU-FUCK YOU! I will show you trash with NO arms!”



The Knight Commander raises his blade above Ryker. 









However, suddenly a messenger of the Knights dashed in with a salute, his armor dented and streaked with soot.



Messenger:

“Sir! Reporting that half of our 150 troops have been wiped out! We have already killed close to a thousand and captured close to three hundred young magic users!



Our intel has said that the other districts are coming to Farmland’s aide with their weapons! We need to retreat sir!”



Knight Commander:

"Grrraaaaagh FUCK! Fine, men take this child, I will deal with him back in Runevia.”



Ryfel's eyes opened wide, his mind absolutely stunned.



Ryfel (mind started racing):

"Runevia????? The other kingdom???



 Ho-How??? Why???"

The Commander lurched forward and kicked Ryfel in a spiteful fit, his boot slamming into Ryfel’s temple. 

Ryfel’s head snapped back, his vision blurring to black as he slumped unconscious. The knights swarmed, their chains clanking as they bound his arms and legs tight. They hoisted him up and retreated toward the gaping hole in the wall. 

Carriages filled with captives—all tied or knocked out in cages—rolled out, wheels crunching over bloodied dirt as they vanished into the woods outside the kingdom, leaving a field of carnage behind them.



The Aftermath

The houses and fields around the Redimir estate lay in ruins, a graveyard of violet fire and shattered lives. 



A thousand souls littered the festival grounds—nobles in torn silks, farmers clutching broken pitchforks, children sprawled beside trampled ribbons.



The bonfire’s embers flickered weakly, casting a faint glow over the slaughter. Horses lay gutted, their riders pinned beneath, violet swords dulled in the dirt.



The Runevian Magic Knights had carved a swath of death—bodies piled where the courts once rang with laughter, now silent but for the crackle of flames.



—



Ryker lay crumpled near the estate’s edge, his severed leg a dark stain against the ground. 



Blood pooled beneath him, his chest rising faintly—alive, but fading fast in the haze of violet smoke, unconscious, he was a broken shield amidst the wreckage.



—



Above, on the shattered roof, Milal sprawled motionless. Tiles cracked under her weight, blood streaking her face from a gash at her temple. 



Her needles lay scattered below, glinting in the firelight—proof of her last stand before the commander’s blow sent her crashing upward. She breathed shallowly, alive but lost to the fight, the violet haze curling around her like a shroud.



—



Dain’s body rested in the woods, a crimson pool beneath him.



His family—Lards, Ham, and Tarby—had escaped, his sacrifice etched in the stab wounds that riddled his chest and gut. His faint smile lingered, a testament to the love that drove him to shield them, now cold in the night’s embrace.



—



Aurex lay closer to the estate woods, silver hair fanned out in the dirt. Blood soaked the ground where he’d fallen, stabbed through the back, chest, and side—his final act shielding Lux in the woods’ opening.



His gold eyes stared blankly, that last smile frozen for his Bright Star, who remained hidden, alive but broken by his loss.



—



Grandpa Ironfoot’s small body but massive earthen frame sprawled near the breached wall, his boulder buried a knight’s head beside him.



Blood streaked his moustache, his chest caved from countless blows—yet his grin held, proud even in death, having roared for Bram until the end. Bram, captured like Ryfel, was gone, leaving the old man’s stand a fading echo.



—



Kriscila and Elda huddled within the estate’s inner halls, alive but trembling. They’d barricaded themselves as the knights stormed past, but as the battle settled, they snuck out to help those who were in need.



—



The violet fire sputtered, smoke rising over a thousand dead and hundreds taken. Farmland’s heart bled—its heroes fallen or stolen, its survivors clinging to ruins as distant horns sounded. Aid was coming, but too late. 



The fields of carnage stretched wide, a testament to the Runevians’ wrath and the Redimirs’ shattered home, with their current only son Ryfel Redimir captured.
